An afternoon avalanche on the busy Plaine-Morte ski track above the resort of Crans-Montana in the Canton of Valais buried several skiers under snow on Tuesday, Swiss police said. Police and rescue teams continued the search for survivors after digging four people out from under the snow. "Rescuers arrived very quickly, they rescued four injured people including one whose life is in danger, and 3 were injured more superficially," Valais cantonal police commander Christian Varone told a news conference. "Witnesses told us there could be more people under the snow, that is why we are pursuing the search with considerable means." Eight helicopters and more than 240 rescuers and police were involved in the search. The Plaine-Morte area is at an altitude of about 3,000 metres (9,800 feet) and is the highest ski piste at the Crans-Montana resort. It is in a bowl high above the resort. More visitors were there than usual as it is the school holiday period. Tuesday's snow slide was rare in that it struck a designated ski area, while the majority of deadly avalanches occur off-piste. cw/msh (AFP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
