European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Thursday announced it will end production of the A380 double-decker passenger jet by 2021. The Franco-German company had hoped the superjumbo would challenge Boeing's 747 and revolutionize air travel in the 21st century. "Without Emirates, Airbus has no substantial order backlog and no basis to sustain A380 production after 2021," said Guillaume Faure, who is taking over as Airbus CEO from Tom Enders this spring. The annoucement was made alongside the news that Airbus net profit had risen 29 percent in 2018 after strong demand for its smaller planes. Airbus managed to make these profits despite 899 million euros ($1 billion) in losses from the A380 aircraft. The company's stocks fared well in trading later on Thursday, rising 4.5 percent with investors apparently relieved by the decision to cut the cord on a losing venture.

"Emirates has been a staunch supporter of the A380 since its inception," said Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum. "While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation." Emirates has ordered 40 A330-900neo jets and 30 A350-900 aircraft instead. Airbus CEO Tom Enders called the superjumbo an "outstanding technical and industrial achievement," adding that the announcement was "painful for us and A380 communities around the world." Airbus A380 landing in Frankfurt What was the problem with the A380? The world's biggest passenger jet started flying in 2008. With two decks of cabins and room for 544 people in standard layout, airlines were reluctant to commit to the costly plane and airports had to build new runways and modify terminals to accommodate it. The project suffered production delays and cost overruns right from the outset. The company was forced to restructure, costing thousands of jobs.

What effect will it have on earnings? Despite losses of €899 million ($1 billion) on the A380, Airbus on Thursday announced a 29 percent rise in profits for 2018. Net profit increased from €2.4 billion to €3.1 billion. Airbus will book a €463 million in shutdown costs but expects to be forgiven a billion euros of outstanding European government loans under a funding system which has been central to its trade dispute with its US rival Boeing. Overall, Airbus expects to deliver 880 to 890 planes this year after 800 last year, with steady demand for the midsize A320 which carries out short and medium-range flights. What happens next? Airbus said it would start talks in the coming weeks with unions over the 3,500 jobs that could be at risk. When the A380 was introduced, it put almost every other competitor on the airfield in the shadows — literally. With a length of 72.7 meters (238 feet) the plane has a wingspan of 79.8 meters and is over 24 meters tall. Singapore Airlines was the first airline to deploy the A380. Here the proud new owners are shown on the tarmac in Toulouse — gathered together to document the great day. Back then on October 15, 2007, the future of passenger flying was still seen in terms of size: The more passengers transported at once, the more profit for the airline. The superjumbo can carry more than 500 passengers in a three-class configuration, which is an increase of more than 100 passengers over its rival, Boeing's 747. Airbus' new aircraft boasts two passenger decks and first-class suites with proper beds. In an all-economy configuration, the plane could carry more than 850 passengers. The A380 was hailed for its roominess, large windows, high ceilings and quieter engines. Some carriers put in showers, lounges, duty free shops and bars on both decks, and passengers could choose to fly in their own private suite. In 2011 and 2012 a number of technical problems with the A380 were reported. Qantas, Emirates and Singapore Airlines all reported A380 flights that had to make emergency landings due to engine issues. In January 2012, Qantas and Singapore Airlines found cracks in the wings of their A380s. Investigations found they were caused by material and manufacturing problems and it cost €263 million to fix. Sadly, the A380's major selling point turned out to be its biggest downfall, with airlines saying they were unable to make the flight profitable if they did not sell every seat on the plane. "It's an aircraft that frightens airline CFOs; the risk of failing to sell so many seats is just too high," one aerospace industry source said. In January and February 2019, both loyal customer Emirates and Australian airline Qantas cancelled orders for the A380. Emirates instead decided to order some smaller planes from Airbus while Qantas withdrew its order for the purchase of eight A380s. After struggling to sell the giant planes, European plane manufacturer Airbus announced it would stop making its superjumbo A380 in 2021 due to lack of customers, bringing the life of the world's biggest passenger jet and one of the aviation industry's most ambitious and most troubled endeavors to an end.
