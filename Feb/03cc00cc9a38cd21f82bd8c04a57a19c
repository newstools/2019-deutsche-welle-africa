Robbers raided dozens of safe deposit boxes from a bank in Belgium at the weekend after tunneling in, prosecutors said. The thieves tunneled up into the vault of an Antwerp branch of BNP Paribas via a nearby sewer system. At 1:34 p.m. (12:34 UTC) the bank's alarm at was triggered despite the vault door remaining locked. By the time authorities made it into the vault, thieves had opened and robbed 20 to 30 deposit boxes and fled into the tunnel. A search of the sewer in Antwerp's famed diamond district found a second four-meter (13-foot) tunnel that led into the basement of an apartment building several hundred meters away from the bank. The robbers presumably descended into the sewer system from the basement, traveling through the sewer before ascending into the bank vault. Police have not said what was stolen, but bank customers were queuing at the branch on Monday to find out if they were victims of the theft. "We are investigating the size of the robbery and we cannot provide further information," the prosecutor's office said in a statement. The police have no major suspects.
