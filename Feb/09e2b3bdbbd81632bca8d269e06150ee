A German convoy was attacked on Saturday as it was returning from a mission to recover a UN transport vehicle 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the soldiers' base in Gao in western Mali, the German military said in a statement Sunday. The soldiers returned fire in the dark after coming under small-arms fire and were able to return safely to camp. A Malian soldier was seriously wounded during the exchange, the Bundeswehr said. "According to the current assessments, it was only later discovered that this was an exchange of fire between the Malian security forces and German forces. It cannot be ruled out or confirmed that the wounded Malian soldier was hit by German forces," the Bundeswehr said.
