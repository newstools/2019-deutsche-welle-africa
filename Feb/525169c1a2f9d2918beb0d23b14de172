This week's Eco Africa show is full of innovative ideas for a greener planet. First we visit South Africa, where demand for endangered plants used in traditional remedies is outstripping supply. But a plant nursery is trying to help species like the pepper-bark tree – whose seedlings can no longer be found in nature. Next, we speak to Agnes Kalibata, president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, about what can be done to ensure food security for the continent. We then check out bamboo bikes in Uganda – their frames are made from the fast-growing plant, making it not only durable and strong, but also light. Germany is our next stop, where the question of whether wolves and humans can coexist is growing ever-more pressing. As wolves return to the country, animal protectionists fear open season will be declared on the creatures. Over in Togo, we see how a pan-African organization there is not just boosting environmental awareness among young people, but also offering new ways to earn. Finally we visit a chimpanzee orphanage in Liberia, where the creatures have had to survive not just two civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, but also poaching and deforestation.
