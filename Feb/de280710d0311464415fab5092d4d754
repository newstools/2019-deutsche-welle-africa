Fire departments across Germany published a flurry of tweets on Monday in honor of European 112 Day, held annually on February 11 to promote the existence and proper use of the Europe-wide emergency number 112. Berlin's fire brigade began what it called a 12-hour "Twitter storm" at 8:00 am local time (7:00 UTC) in which it published every 112 call it received. "Attention! Brace yourselves for a current turbulent Twitter storm! ... So you better sit back and look at your digital windows," Berlin's fire brigade said on Twitter. The campaign is meant to make the work of emergency services transparent, to interest potential new recruits and to show how many emergency calls have to be handled every day. A total of 41 fire departments nationwide were expected to participate as well, including those Hamburg, Munich, Düsseldorf and Bremen.
