Thailand's Election Commission on Monday officially disqualified Princess Ubolratana Mahidol from running for prime minister in the upcoming election. The princess announced her candidacy on Friday, stunning the country and sparking questions over whether she would be allowed to enter politics as a member of the royal family. She relinquished her royal status years ago to marry an American citizen, but is still widely depicted and regarded as a royal. “Every member of the royal family comes from within the application of the same rule requiring the monarch to be above politics and to be politically neutral,” the Election Commission said.
