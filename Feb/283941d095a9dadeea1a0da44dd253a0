The European Union on Friday said it was "taking the steps needed" to ensure flights between Britain and the European Union could continue if Britain exits the bloc without a deal on March 29.

EU negotiators are developing contingency measures to address vital areas in the event Britain leaves the EU without agreeing a deal. These sectors include aviation, transport of goods and finance.
