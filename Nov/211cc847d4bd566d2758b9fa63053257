Schools reopened on Wednesday in New Delhi after the toxic air level was reduced by more than half since last weekend, when authorities declared a public health emergency. Strong winds were responsible for blowing away pollutants from the Indian capital. The city's air quality index (AQI), which measures the concentration of poisonous particles, was recorded at 216 in the "poor" category on Wednesday. At the weekend, New Delhi experienced its worst air quality day since 2016 with an AQI of 494, in the "severe" category — 500 is the maximum score and anything above 400 is considered hazardous to health. This was the worst AQI for three years and one of the worst on record. Many people took to the streets to protest a lack of action from the government in dealing with the ongoing issue.
