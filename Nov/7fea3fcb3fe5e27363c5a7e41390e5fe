Jürgen Klinsmann is to return to Germany's Bundesliga to take up a seat on the supervisory board of Hertha BSC Berlin, his agent has confirmed. The move means 55-year-old Klinsmann will oversee the management of the club by Managing Directors Michael Preetz and Ingo Schiller. Agent Roland Eitel told the German news agency dpa that Hertha's principal investor Lars Windhorst, who on Friday upped his share in the club to almost 50%, had pushed for the appointment. As a player, Klinsmann helped West Germany win the 1990 World Cup and was twice named his country's Footballer of the Year.
