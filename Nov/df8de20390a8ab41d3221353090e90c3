Pakistan and India on Saturday opened a new corridor and border crossing to facilitate the Indian followers of Sikh faith to visit one of their holiest shrines. India's state TV reported that the first few hundred pilgrims made the journey along the secure visa-free corridor between the two nuclear foes. About 90 minutes later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took part in an inauguration ceremony at the border post on the Indian side. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan was set to arrive in Kartarpur later in the day. The shrine to Sikhism's founder Guru Nanak lies in Kartarpur, a small town just four kilometers (2.5 miles) into Pakistani territory. Kartapur ended up in the Muslim-majority country following the division of India and Pakistan at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Tensions between the neighbors, who have fought three wars since independence, have made it difficult for those Indian Sikhs who wish to make the pilgrimage. Sikh groups have long been demanding a road link and easing of travel permits. mm/aw (AFP, dpa)
