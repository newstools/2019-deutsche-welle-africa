Eight people, including at least four foreign tourists, were stabbed in the Jordanian city of Jerash on Wednesday, according to police. The tourists, a tour guide and a security officer were stabbed near the Roman ruins for which the town is famous. Three of the tourists were Mexican nationals and another was from Switzerland. "Around noon, a man attacked tourists, a tour guide and a security officer who tried to stop him in Jerash," a spokesman for the public security directorate said in a statement. "The wounded were transported to hospital for treatment," he added. "The assailant was immediately arrested."
