Japanese authorities seized 400 kilograms (882 pounds) of cocaine in a bust in Kobe, a port city in the west of Japan, local sources said on Thursday. Authorities found the drugs in shipping containers at the port. It is unclear where they came from. An investigation is ongoing. The local sources say it is possible the drugs were sent to Kobe by mistake. The bust occurred in October and was "record-breaking in terms of volume" in Japan, a customs spokesman said. The drugs are estimated to be worth around $73 million (€66 million).
