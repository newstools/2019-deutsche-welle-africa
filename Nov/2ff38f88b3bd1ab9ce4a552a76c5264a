Thousands of Dutch teachers went on strike on Wednesday leading to mass disruption in schools across the Netherlands. Teachers are protesting a perceived lack of funding, a rise in the amount of "burnout" rates and a teacher shortage, according to the European Trade Union Committee for Education (ETUCE). The long-planned strike went ahead even though Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte reached an agreement with trade unions and schools last week, according to the Associated Press. This would see an additional €460 million ($510 million) investment into education. Rutte pledged this money would tackle the teacher shortage, improve working conditions and raise salaries.
