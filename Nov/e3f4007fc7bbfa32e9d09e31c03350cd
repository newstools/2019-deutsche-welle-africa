"These findings provide direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury within the lungs." Vitamin E acetate is found in many products, but is harmful if its droplets are inhaled. CDC added that although no other potential toxins were found it remained possible that more than one chemical could be the culprit.

Vitamin E acetate has been used as a thickener, particularly in black market vape cartridges. In September, New York State's health department reported it found "very high levels" of vitamin E acetate in nearly all cannabis-containing samples from patients in the state. CDC said that many of those who have become sick reported buying black market THC containing products.
