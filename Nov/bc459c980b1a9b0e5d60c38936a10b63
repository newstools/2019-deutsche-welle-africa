Exit polls after presidential elections in Romania on Sunday show that incumbent President Klaus Iohannis will likely fail to receive an outright majority, making a runoff necessary. The exit poll by IRES pollster suggested the 60-year-old centrist liberal received some 39% support, with Social Democrat (PSD) leader Viorica Dancila in second place with 22%. That would mean a runoff with Dancila on November 24.

Dancila was prime minister until last month, when her PSD was ousted in a no-confidence vote over corruption allegations. Last week, parliament approved a new transitional minority government of new PM Ludovic Orban of the centrist National Liberal Party. Orban will steer the country towards a general election next year.

The president is commander in chief of the armed forces, nominates a prime minister — who has executive powers — and can veto laws adopted by parliament. Observers said a win for Iohannis might bolster the National Liberal Party's chance of forming a stronger coalition after next year's parliamentary election and restore investor confidence eroded by several years of political instability and high levels of public spending. Romania has faced European Union monitoring over progress on reform of its judiciary since 2007. But a succession of PSD governments has tried to roll back certain anti-corruption rules in recent years, joining the ranks of other ex-communist states in the bloc in incurring criticism over the rule of law.

He also spearheaded a national referendum where an overwhelming majority of Romanians said they wanted the government to be banned from altering legislation via emergency decrees, and advocated a national ban on granting amnesties and pardons for graft-related crimes.
