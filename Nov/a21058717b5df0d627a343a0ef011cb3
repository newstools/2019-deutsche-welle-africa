"Our liberal-conservative policy has clearly been rejected by voters in Saxony and Thuringia. It is therefore logical, although painful, to end our project at this point," Petry said. The decision to dissolve the Blue Party by the end of the year was made at a party conference over the weekend. Left the AfD after election Petry quit the AfD soon after she was elected to parliament in the 2017 general election, arguing the party had become too extreme. She remains a member of the Bundestag as an independent. She had established the Blue Party hoping to snatch votes from those who support Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the far-right AfD.
