The High Court in Hong Kong ruled on Monday that a controversial ongoing ban on face masks was unconstitutional.

There is no suggestion that the ban drop will do anything to quell protests. The news come after a weekend of clashes between protesters and police. Violence has escalated in recent weeks as organizers urged protesters to "blossom everywhere" to cause maximum disruption. The protests were triggered in June by a proposed law allowing for the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland China. The legislation was seen by many in Hong Kong as an attempt by Beijing to erode the autonomy guaranteed when Britain handed the territory over to China in 1997. Although the bill was ultimately dropped, the protests have expanded into a wider resistance movementdemanding full democracy.
