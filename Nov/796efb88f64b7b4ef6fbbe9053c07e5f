Germany's upper house of parliament on Friday blocked parts of the government's climate package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Lawmakers in the Bundesrat — which represents the governments of Germany's 16 federal states — paved the way for most of the measures to enter into force, but unanimously voted to send parts of it related to taxes and subsidies to a mediation committee between the upper house and lower house, or Bundestag.

In all, the Bundesrat voted on four climate-related bills. The climate protection law, an increase in aviation tax and introduction of an initial CO2 price of €10 ($11) per ton were all approved. The climate protection act makes it a legal obligation for Germany to cut greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Lawmakers hope the mediation committee between the two chambers of parliament can reach a consensus before Christmas, a goal some state representatives find overly ambitious or improbable. cw/rt (AFP, dpa, epd, Reuters) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
