Iraqi security forces killed at least four people and injured more than 50 others on Thursday. They used rubber bullets, tear gas, and live rounds to disperse hundreds of protesters gathered in central Baghdad, according to medical and security officials. Three demonstrators were killed in Tahrir Square when tear gas canisters struck them directly in the head Thursday morning. A fourth died later in a hospital from wounds sustained from a stun bomb.

Protesters set fire to a local official's house in the town of Gharraf late Wednesday evening.
