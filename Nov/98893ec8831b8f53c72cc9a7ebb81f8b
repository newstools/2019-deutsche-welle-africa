In the 1980s and early 1990s, Lebanese and Palestinians fled to Germany during the Lebanon's civil war. The Iraq war in the 2000s and post-2015 migrant influx brought more Arabs to the capital, mostly from Syria and Iraq. According to statistics from 2017, there are around 133,000 people with an Arab background from more than 20 countries living in Berlin. That accounts for about 4% of the capital's population.
