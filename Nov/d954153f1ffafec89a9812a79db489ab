A German Green party lawmaker with Turkish roots won a runoff election on Sunday to become the mayor of the city of Hanover. This is the first time that a German with immigrant parents was elected mayor of a state capital. Belit Onay received 52.9% of the vote, ahead of the 47.1% for center-right candidate Eckhard Scholz of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats. "I promise all of you that I will do my best for our city over the next seven years," Onay tweeted on Sunday evening. Hanover now becomes Germany's fourth major city to elect a Green party mayor, following Freiburg, Darmstadt and Stuttgart. The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) had governed the city for over 70 years. Onay, a 38-year-old legal expert, was elected after the SPD's Stefan Schostok stood down from his position as mayor of  the Lower Saxony capital earlier this year amid a corruption scandal. ed/dr (dpa, AP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
