Protest leader arrives In the meantime, protest leader Luis Fernando Camacho arrived in the Bolivian capital, La Paz, demanding Morales' resignation over the rigging accusations. Camacho, a civic leader from the eastern city of Santa Cruz, plans to head for the presidential palace to give an already written resignation letter for Morales to merely sign. Demonstrators display a banner against Bolivia's President Evo Morales Carlos Mesa, who was Morales' nearest rival in the election, met Camacho at the airport upon his arrival. "I think this is a fundamental moment for the opposition that believes in a democratic response and a peaceful way out," said Mesa, who has joined the chorus of disapproval over Morales' electoral victory. Morales, who has been in power since 2006, has defended his victory, claiming that the opposition is trying to lead a "coup" against him and that his rivals were to blame for the violent response. jsi/rt (AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
