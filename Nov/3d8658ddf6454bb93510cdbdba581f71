Unflappable faith Almost 40 years after he left office, the former Democratic president still continues to teach at a Sunday school on a twice-monthly basis at Maranatha Baptist Church in his small hometown of Plains, in southwest Georgia. Reverend Tony Lowden, Carter's pastor, said the ex-president was admitted to hospital on what he described as "a rough day." "We just need the whole country to be in prayer for him," Lowden told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. The church confirmed Carter will not be teaching his Sunday school class this week. Carter is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him, the hospital said. Carter was the 39th president of the United States, holding office from 1977 until 1981, when he was replaced by Republican Ronald Reagan. jsi/cmk (AFP, Reuters, AP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
