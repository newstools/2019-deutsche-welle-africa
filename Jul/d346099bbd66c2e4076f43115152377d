A forest fire raging through a former military exercise ground in northern Germany has spread to an area the size of more than 800 football fields, authorities said Tuesday. Firefighters have been hampered in their struggle to battle the flames due to the presence of unexploded mines and ordnance in the soil, some dating back to World War II.

Health experts warned people with allergies and asthma to stay indoors. With more than 2,000 firefighters and rescue crews working around the clock, the military commander in the state said emergency forces were "going from defense to offense" to extinguish the fire. Currently, firefighters from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein are working four shifts a day to bring the blaze under control. Armored recovery vehicles have also been deployed to clear paths through the forest for firefighters, who have had to take extra caution to avoid the old munitions. Up to eight firefighting helicopters are supporting the operation. Four small towns have been evacuated and officials say that some 780 people have been forced to move to emergency shelters. The armored recovery vehicles can be used to clear stretches of trees. js,cw/jm (AFP, dpa) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
