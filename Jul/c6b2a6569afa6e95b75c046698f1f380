Global Affairs Canada confirmed on Saturday that a Canadian citizen had been detained in the port city of Yantai, without providing details about the identity of the individual detained or the reason for the detention. Tension between Beijing and Ottawa heightened in December after Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a warrant from the United States. Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, is currently under house arrest in Vancouver.

The Canadian government has called the charges against them "arbitrary," fueling speculation that they were detained in retaliation for Meng's arrest.
