All except the Brazilians are water polo players. "We were just dancing and then the next minute we dropped five to six meters and everyone started rushing out of the club after that," said New Zealand men's water polo team captain Matt Small. "We ... fell on top of the heads of other people that were beneath us," he told New Zealand's Radio Sport. Authorities have said none of the injuries were severe, ranging from bruising to lacerations on their hands or feet. The incident occurred in a nightclub next to the athletes' village in Gwangju, South Korea, where athletes have been competing at 18th FINA World Aquatics Championships. The competition runs until Sunday.
