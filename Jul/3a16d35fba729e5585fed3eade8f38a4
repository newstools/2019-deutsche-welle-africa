Around 300 residents of a North Sea coast campsite were evacuated on Saturday after smoke from a massive nearby fire engulfed the holiday resort. The blaze broke out at around 5 p.m local time (1500 UTC) in a cornfield close to the campsite on Lake Kransburg, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Hamburg. Reports described how the fire quickly sent clouds of thick smoke through the air as it spread.
