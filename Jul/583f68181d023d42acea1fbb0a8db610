The Bulgarian Parliament on Friday approved the purchase of eight new US-made F-16 fighter jets for a hefty $1.3 billion (€1.1 billion). "Bulgaria will be the first Balkan country to have this brand-new version of the aircraft," said Defense Minister Krasimir Karakachanov. Six of the F-16 Block 70 multi-role fighters will have a single seat while the other two will have two. They will replace the NATO country's Soviet-built MiG-29s of which only seven are still able to fly. The F-16's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, said the fighter jets are "a proven, capable, low-risk and cost effective solution for Bulgaria's national and NATO defense needs."
