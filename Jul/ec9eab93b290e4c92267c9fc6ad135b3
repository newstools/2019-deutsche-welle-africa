Some 8,000 people took to the streets of Kassel to protest against a neo-Nazi rally in the western German city. Police said they expected around 500 supporters of the extremist The Right ("Die Rechte") party to attend the rally. However, none had shown up by the time the demonstration was supposed to begin at noon. The Right said the protest was against the "disgusting" way in which the media has used the killing of a local politician to paint right-wing movements as extremists. Walter Lübcke, a supporter of Chancellor Merkel's open refugee policy, was shot in the head at his home near the city of Kassel on June 2.
