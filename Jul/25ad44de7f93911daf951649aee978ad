Police in the central German state of Hesse are investigating whether a right-wing extremist suspected of murdering a local politician was also involved in the unsolved stabbing of an asylum-seeker more than three years earlier. State prosecutors in the city of Kassel said on Friday that Stephan E. was under suspicion of stabbing a 22-year-old Iraqi refugee in January 2016. The perpetrator critically injured the man before fleeing the scene. Police searched Stephan E.'s home on Thursday as part of the investigation.
