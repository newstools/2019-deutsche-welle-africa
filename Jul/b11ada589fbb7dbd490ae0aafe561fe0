A gunman shot dead a Turkish diplomat in the Kurdish Iraqi city of Irbil on Wednesday, before fleeing the scene. A local citizen was also killed, according to the Kurdish security service. Turkey's Foreign Ministry said one of its staff had been killed in the shooting at the popular HuQQabaz restaurant close to Ankara's diplomatic mission to the autonomous region. Local media reported that the individual was Turkey's vice-consul in the city. "The attacker walked into the restaurant and headed to a table where the three were sitting. He drew out two pistols and started shooting intensely at them. Then, he — the shooter — escaped," the owner told journalists. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the shooting.
