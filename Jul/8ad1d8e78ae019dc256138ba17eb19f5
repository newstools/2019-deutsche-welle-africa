Crashing into a police vehicle with that amount of drugs on board is somewhat unheard of — it's an exceptional set of circumstances," he said. Police located and stopped the van within around an hour of the incident, which was captured on CCTV. One patrol car was totalled. Nobody was injured. The driver, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and charged with large commercial drug supply and negligent driving.
