Chinese authorities on Monday said Beijing fully supports police in establishing the rule of law in Hong Kong after violent unrest over the weekend. "Violence is violence, unlawful acts are unlawful. It doesn't change, no matter what the target," said Yang Guang, spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, considered the top mainland authority for the semi-autonomous city.
