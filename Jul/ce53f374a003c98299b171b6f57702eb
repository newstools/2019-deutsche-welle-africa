China launched an investigation into US delivery company FedEx for illegally withholding more than 100 Huawei packages, the state-run Xinhua news agency said on Friday. "The investigation showed that FedEx was suspected of holding up more than 100 Huawei packages from entering China," Xinhua said. "Investigators also discovered clues to other violations of the company." In May, FedEx apologized for "misrouting" what it described as a "small number" of packages for the Chinese technology giant.
