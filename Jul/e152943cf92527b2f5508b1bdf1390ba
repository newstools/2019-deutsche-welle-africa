Greece's New Democracy party leader Kyrikos Mitsotakis was sworn in as prime minister on Monday following snap elections that saw him defeat left-wing Alexis Tsipras . Mitsotakis' New Democracy party won 39.8% of the vote, giving him 158 seats in the 300-member parliament, a comfortable governing majority. Tsipras' Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, garnered 31.5%. The extremist right-wing Golden Dawn, Greece's third largest party during the height of the financial crisis, failed to make the 3% threshold to enter parliament. "The Greek people gave us a strong mandate to change Greece. We will honor it to the full," Mitsotakis said after taking his oath of office in a televised ceremony. "Hard work begins today. I am completely confident that we will prove equal to the challenge." The cabinet will be sworn in on Tuesday and will meet on Wednesday, he said. Hardvard-educated Mitsotakis is the son of former Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, one of the country's longest-serving parliamentarians. His sister Dora Bakoyannis is a former minister and Athens's first female mayor.

Greece's public debt last year stood at €335 billion ($376 billion), or 180% of GDP. The debt load is forecast to fall to 168% of GDP this year, but only under austerity measures brought in under Tsipras's Syriza party, which Mitsotakis's New Democracy party says is stifling growth. Mitsotakis, a former banker, has also pledged to create jobs and "steamroller" obstacles to business. law/rc (AP, dpa) DW sends out a daily selection of hard news and quality feature journalism.
