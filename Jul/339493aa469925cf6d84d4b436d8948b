Two Olympic gold medalists who were accused of corruption relating to the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics denied any wrongdoing on Thursday despite claims made against them in a Brazilian court. Russia's Alexander Popov (above left) and Ukraine's Sergey Bubka (above right) had been accused of accepting money to vote for Rio to be the location for the summer games. Bubka and Popov were members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) when Rio was selected the host at a voting session in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2009. The city won the vote against the Spanish capital of Madrid by 66 votes to 32.
