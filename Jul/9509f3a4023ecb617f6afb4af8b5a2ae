The case dates back to 2014 when the European Commission said BMW should receive no more than €17 million ($18.9 million) in state grants to develop production of two electric and hybrid passenger cars in the eastern city of Leipzig. The German state had planned to grant €45 million for the project to develop the i3 and i8 production lines, which was expected to create 800 jobs. The Commission ruled that any amount above €17 million would be incompatible with EU internal market rules.

BMW had previously lost a case before the General Court of the European Union, the bloc's second-highest, in September 2017. BMW reported that it has invested €2 billion in the Leipzig plant where 5,300 employees build four models. About 245,000 cars came off the production line in 2018. jm/msh (Reuters, dpa) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features. Sign up here.
