German-Iranian poker master Hossein Ensan on Wednesday won the World Series of Poker main event in Las Vegas, beating Italian rival Dario Sammartino. "This is the best feeling in my life," said Ensan. "I am so happy I'm here with the bracelet in hand." He noted that while strategy plays a big part of the game, good cards and a bit of luck go a long way. He described his Italian rival Sammartino as a "good player," saying: "But short-handed you need cards. You need hands, and for sure luck. And luck and hands were on my side. Otherwise, I'd be runner-up."
