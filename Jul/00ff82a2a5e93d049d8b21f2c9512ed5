A police station in the Bavarian town of Starnberg came under attack by a group of teenagers who were trying to break out one of their friends, German police said on Friday. Previously, a security employee had called the police over rowdy behavior at a school graduation party. The officers at the scene found a 15-year-old who was "visibly under significant influence of alcohol" and "remained aggressive" in the presence of the patrol. He ignored police orders to leave the venue, prompting the officers to detain him.

Members of the group threw bottles at the station windows, breaking one window pane, police said. The students also attempted to remove the police shield from the door.
