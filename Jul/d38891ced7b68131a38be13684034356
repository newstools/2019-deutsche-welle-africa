Former Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo was arrested in the United States on Tuesday and faces possible extradition to Peru on corruption charges. Toledo, who served as president from 2001-2006, "was arrested this morning for extradition, in the United States," Peru's Justice Ministry said on Twitter. The 73-year-old stands accused of receiving $20 million (€18 million) from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to win public works contracts to build a highway connecting Peru and Brazil. He denies the charges. Peruvian Justice Minister Vicente Zeballos said Toledo's extradition could take up to a year. Odebrecht has admitted to paying $800 million in bribes to officials in a dozen countries across Latin America. The Odebrecht scandal has ensnared officials across Latin America, including three other former Peruvian presidents. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, president from 2016-2018, is being held in pretrial detention on graft charges. Alan Garcia, who served two terms as president between 1985-1990 and 2006-2011, fatally shot himself in the head in April when police came to arrest him in connection with a corruption probe. Former President Ollanta Humala (2011-2016) is also awaiting trial for graft and money laundering. cw/bw (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
