The launch is set to take place from the island of Sriharikota, just north of the southern city of Chennai. Aboard the rocket is an orbiter that will circle the moon for about a year taking surface images, and a landing vessel carrying a lunar rover named Vikram. ISRO chief K. Sivan told The Hindu newspaper on Sunday that there was "no chance for any technical fault to arise now." "When the technical fault happened, we stopped the countdown, identified the issue, and rectified it."
