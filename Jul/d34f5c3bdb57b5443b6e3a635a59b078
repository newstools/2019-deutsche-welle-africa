Hawaiian shirts or bike shorts? Polo shirts or cropped jeans? What’s your favorite summer style – and what will be the hottest trend for the hottest season? We asked you for a picture of your personal summer 2019 style. Thanks for all your entries! We drew one lucky winner from all the pictures we received: It’s Gonzalo Freile from Ecuador.  Along with our congratulations we’re sending a Euromaxx watch to Quito, so that the next motorbike tour can kick off on time!
