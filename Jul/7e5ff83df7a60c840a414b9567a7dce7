A shooting at a gas station in the southern French town of Ollioules on Sunday night killed three people and wounded one other. Two men and one woman were among those killed, regional newspaper Var-Martin reported. The incident took place shortly before 8:00 p.m. (1800 UTC), when at least two youth opened fire at the station, located on the outskirts of the Mediterranean city of Toulon. It is unclear whether others were involved in the shooting. The nationalities of the victims were not immediately known. But French authorities said they did not appear to be the targets, and were instead killed by stray bullets.
