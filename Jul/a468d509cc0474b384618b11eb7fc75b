An unidentified climber on Monday scaled the 310-meter (1,017-foot) Shard skyscraper in the British capital, London, apparently without the aid of safety harnesses or ropes. The man was sighted by witnesses on the tower at sunrise. He was reportedly taken in for questioning by police after reaching the top of the building. London police say the man was not arrested after his feat. The building has been climbed in the past, but its proprietors secured a court injunction against Alain Robert, popularly known as the French Spiderman, who wanted to make an attempt in 2012. In 2013, Greenpeace activists climbed the building as a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic. The Shard, located on the banks of the River Thames near London Bridge, houses offices, restaurants, a retail arcade and a hotel. It was inaugurated in 2012. Whether in Berlin, London, Paris, Dubai or New York - skyscrapers and towers with views are popular places for photos in times of Instagram. Not only followers like spectacular views over a city. The TV Tower (368 metres) on Alexanderplatz is the tallest building in Germany. If the weather is fine, you can see up to 40 kilometres from the observation deck. One floor above there is a restaurant that turns on its own axis in half an hour. The Berlin Victory Column (1873) towers 69 metres above the Tiergarten. At the top of this historic vantage point in the German capital stands Victoria, the goddess of victory. The eight meter high figure is also called "Gold-Else". 285 steps lead up to the viewing platform at a height of 50 metres via a narrow spiral staircase. Around the Victory Column, car traffic rages on the place "Gro√üer Stern", but the park landscape of the Tiergarten stretches all around. It is almost impossible to photograph the highest building in the world (828 meters high) in its entirety. The building has become a landmark for the United Arab Emirates. Who wants to enjoy the panorama from above, takes the lift up to 452 meters height. Since the opening in 2010, this view of downtown Dubai has been possible in principle. On many days, however, haze and dust obscure the view of Dubai Mall and Fountain Lake, which in the dark surprises visitors with illuminated fountains. In the skyline of the French capital, the Tour Montparnasse is an imposition for many. But the highest building of the French capital after the Eiffel Tower (300 meters) with a height of 210 meters offers the best view to all Parisian landmarks. The viewing platform is open daily from 09:30 - 23:30. We recommend the day/night ticket for 23 euros, which allows two visits within 48 hours. The terrace of the Paris skyscraper overlooking the Eiffel Tower is also a popular location for yoga classes. It is the highest building in New York and is also called Freedom Tower. Because here the National 9/11 Memorial commemorates the victims of the terrorist attack of 2001. This is where the World Trade Center with the Twin Towers used to stand. With the elevators (Sky Pods) it goes in 47 seconds to the 102nd floor. Here New York lies at one's feet. The viewing platform extends over three different levels. All visitors must pass through the security checkpoint. Only a small bag is allowed. There is no cloakroom or lockers on site. With the Stop'n Watch telescope you can take a look at the banking district of the Main metropolis. As Frankfurt's only high-rise building to date, it invites visitors to a viewing platform at a height of 200 metres. Frankfurt at night is a frequent photo motif. At #maintower you can find a selection of snapshots of the Main Tower visitors. The glass viewing platform under the top of the skyscraper "Shard" offers a unique view over the British capital on beautiful days. But the view to the Thames, the Tower Bridge, the City - the business centre or the famous power station of Battersea can also have a great attraction in light fog.
