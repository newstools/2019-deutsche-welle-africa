Two hundred gamers have gathered in the eastern US city of New York for the first Fortnite World Cup, where they will compete on Saturday and Sunday for prize money totaling $30 million (€26.9 million). Fortnite, a game in which players are dropped on a virtual island where they have to try to stay alive, in part by eliminating other participants with weapons they pick up in the course of the action, has 250 million users worldwide. Each competitor at this year's tournament is guaranteed to win at least $50,000, with the first prize worth $3 million — almost equalling the $3.85 million that will be won by the singles champions at this year's US Open Tennis Championships, held at the same Arthur Ashe Stadium venue.
