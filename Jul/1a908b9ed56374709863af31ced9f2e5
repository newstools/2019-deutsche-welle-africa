Ocasio-Cortez said she was from the United States and swore allegiance to the country, adding that the president could not "conceive of an America that includes us." Omar, Pressley and Tlaib and dozens of other Democratic lawmakers, senior party figures and presidential candidates also denounced the comment as racist and xenophobic in separate tweets. Republican lawmakers remained mostly silent. Three of Trump's apparent targets — Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Tlaib — were born and raised in the United States. Omar was born in Somalia and moved to the US when she was 12 years old. Trump has repeatedly been accused of racism as a candidate and during his presidency. Since 2015, he has said many Mexicans are "rapists," called migration across the US-Mexican border an "infestation" and described some people attending a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia as "very fine people." amp/se (AP, AFP) DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
