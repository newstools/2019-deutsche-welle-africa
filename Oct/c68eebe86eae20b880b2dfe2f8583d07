South African former-President Jacob Zuma has lost his bid to have a corruption case against him dropped, which he claims is politically motivated. A court in Pietermaritzburg on Friday denied Zuma a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma, who was in office from 2009-2018, has been accused of taking bribes from French defense company Thales in connection with a 1999 multi-billion dollar arms purchase, which he oversaw as vice president. The charges against Zuma were originally filed a decade ago but then set aside by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) shortly before he ran for president in 2009. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison.

Zuma, who slipped out of the court quietly after the decision, can appeal the ruling or ask for a postponement. Zuma was forced to resign in 2018 in connection with separate corruption accusations involving the influential and controversial Gupta family, who have also been subject to US sanctions. Meanwhile, his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to crack down on the corruption that has eroded support for Zuma's and Ramaphosa's party, the African National Congress (ANC). It has ruled the country since the end of apartheid in 1994. ng/sms (Reuters, AFP, AP, dpa) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3QrCp DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
