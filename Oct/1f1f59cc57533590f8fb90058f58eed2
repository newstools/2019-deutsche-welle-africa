The Jamaican team led the first of the evening's sprint relays from start to finish to record a time of 41.44 seconds and hold off a challenge from Great Britain, with 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith anchoring her team to the silver in 41.85sec. The United States team came in third. Fraser-Pryce, 32, won the 100m last weekend and her ninth gold medal means only American Allyson Felix (12) and Usain Bolt (11) remain ahead of her in the all time individual standings. Christian Coleman and Noah Lyles also claimed their second golds in Doha as a formidable US men's 4x100 team won equally comfortably, with Great Britain again in second and Japan claiming bronze. Veteran US sprinter Justin Gatlin won his first relay medal in the process, as the US team clocked the third fastest relay ever recorded. "We are a brotherhood," said the 2017 100m world champion. "We had a talk this morning and we said we are going to go out there and do this. I wanted it especially hard as I have never won a relay title." Unique feat, German bronze Earlier in the day, Germany's Konstanze Klosterhalfen, part of the Nike-backed Oregon Project whose head coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years earlier in the week, took bronze in 14min 28.43sec in a 5000 meter race won by Kenya's Hellen Obiri. The 29-year-old came home clear of compatriot Margaret Kipkemboi in a championship record time of 14min 26.72sec. German athlete Konstanze Klosterhalfen celebrates her bronze Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands completed a unique double when she dominated the 1,500 meters, adding to the 10,000 meters title she won earlier in the competition. In doing so, she became the first athlete, male or female, to win the two events at a single Olympic Games or world championships. After Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce won the 100-meter sprint at the Athletics World Championships in Doha, she celebrated her victory with son Zyon. "It was a long journey," the Jamaican sprinter said of the time it took for her to get back into shape – not only physically but also mentally. Allyson Felix won a record 12th world title and her first since becoming a mother last November, as part of the US team that took the 4x400 meters mixed relay in Doha. After she became pregnant, the six-time Olympic champion got into a dispute with her then-sponsor Nike, which had offered her a 70-percent pay cut as she was forced to take a break from the sport. Felix now has a different sponsor. According to her own account, the birth by C-section of daughter Alexis Olympia on September 1, 2017, almost cost the then 36-year-old her life. Since returning to the tennis court following a 13-month break, Williams has reached four Grand Slam finals but hasn’t won any of them. Margaret Court had a much easier time of it. The 24-time Grand Slam winner, whose record Serena Williams continues to chase, had three children during her playing career, only retiring from the game after she'd become pregnant four a fourth time. In June 2015 Marit Björgen announced that she was pregnant and would sit out the following World Cup season – with the goal of returning for the 2017 Nordic World Ski Championships in Lahti. After the birth of her son Marius, the Norwegian record world champion went on to win four titles at the 2017 Worlds and a year later she followed this up with two Olympic gold medals in Pyeongchang. When the Swedish swimmer put her career on hold due to pregnancy in 2013 she had already won numerous World and European Championship titles, plus three Olympic medals – none of which was gold. Alshammar hasn’t been at the top level since returning to the pool, but she did take part in her sixth Olympic Games in Rio in 2016, when she was Sweden's flag-bearer. Only four months after the birth of her daughter, the star biathlete won the silver medal at the World Championships. The Belarusian followed this success up with several World Cup victories, Olympic silver in the pursuit in 2018 and relay gold. In 2018, Domracheva called time on her career. She now coaches China’s national biathlon team long with her husband Ole Einar Björndalen (pictured). US cyclist Kristin Armstrong’s son Lucas looks about as happy as his mother after she won Olympic gold in the time trial at the 2012 Games in London. In doing so, she defended the title she had won in Beijing four years earlier. In Rio in 2016, she made it three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the race against the clock. Isabell Werth gave birth to son Frederick 10 years ago and now he can say that his mother is the most successful dressage rider in the world, having won six Olympic gold medals, four Olympic silver medals, nine World Championship titles and 20 European championship titles. That’s not to mention several national titles. By the time her son Toni was born in 1989, Heike Drechsler had already won gold medals for East Germany in the long jump at both the World and European Championships. She’d also won gold in the 200 meters at the European Championships. After giving birth, she won Olympic gold for Germany in the long jump in Barcelona in 1992 and Sydney eight years later. Soon successful tennis mother Kim Clijsters will be back on the WTA tour. The Belgian knows a thing or two about comebacks: In 2007 she retired at the age of 23. In 2009 she gave birth to a daughter before resuming her career and winning three Grand Slam tournaments. She retired for a second time in 2012. Now a mother of three, she has announced another comeback for 2020. Author: Andreas Sten-Ziemons mp/jh (Reuters, AFP)
