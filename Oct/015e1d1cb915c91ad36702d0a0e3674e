Germany joined the US, UK, and Australia on Saturday in calling on Facebook to rethink its plans to introduce new encryption for its main platform as well as chat services Messenger and WhatsApp. Facebook had announced in March that it intends to roll out end-to-end encryption for all its services.

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has argued that privacy concerns outweigh possible benefits to law enforcement. There are also worries that back-door access could reduce overall security es/rc (AFP, dpa)
