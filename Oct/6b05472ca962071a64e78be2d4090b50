The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered auto giant Daimler to recall several hundred thousand vehicles for breaking diesel emissions regulations, the car manufacturer said Friday.

However, Daimler has steadfastly pleaded its innocence in the so-called dieselgate scandal that arose in 2015, when Volkswagen admitted having installed illegal "defeat devices" in 11 million diesel vehicles across the globe. The latest demand relates to at least 260,000 Mercedes-Benz "Sprinter" vans, the company confirmed, adding that all the offending vehicles had been made prior to June 2016. The KBA opened an investigation, according to German media, suspecting Daimler of installing "illegal software" aimed at making the cars appear greener than they really were. jsi/dr (dpa, AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
