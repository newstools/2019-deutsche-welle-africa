Outgoing European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Tuesday that the European Union had done "everything in its power" to make an orderly Brexit possible. Juncker made the comments to the European Parliament in a review of his time in office, saying Brexit had dominated his five-year mandate to the detriment of the citizens of the bloc. In his farewell speech, Juncker urged Europe to "fight ignorant nationalism with all your strength."

"We need now to watch events in Westminster very closely, but it's not possible, not imaginable that this parliament would ratify the agreement before Westminster has ratified the agreement. First London, then Brussels and Strasbourg," he said. European Council President Donald Tusk said he was discussing London's request for another extension to Brexit with the leaders of the other 27 member states and would make a decision "in the coming days." "A no-deal Brexit will never be our decision," Tusk said, receiving applause from EU lawmakers. Johnson faces two major votes on the approval of the 115-page Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the British Parliament on Tuesday, either of which could scupper his promise to leave the European Union in nine days. aw/rt (AFP, AP, dpa) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
