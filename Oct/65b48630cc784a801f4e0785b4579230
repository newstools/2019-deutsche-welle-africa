The former US ambassador to Ukraine has told Congress that President Donald Trump pressured the state department to remove her from her role. Marie Yovanovitch, who was abruptly removed from her role in May, made the statement as part of her testimony in the ongoing impeachment inquiry against President Trump. The diplomat, who is still employed by the state department, said she was told by an official that there was a "concerted campaign against me" over the course of a year while Trump pressured officials to remove her. She said the decision to remove her was "based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives." Yovanovitch also testified that she never called on Ukrainian officials to refrain from investigating or prosecuting corruption.
