Firefighters were battling early Thursday to put out a blaze that tore through Japan's Shuri Castle. A police spokesman said the fire had destroyed much of the historic complex, including the castle's main temple and its north and south halls. Located in the city of Naha on the southern island of Okinawa, Shuri is a popular tourist destination and a symbolically important site for the region. "I feel as if we have lost our symbol," said Naha Mayor Mikiko Shiroma. "I'm shocked." Shuri was first built more than 500 years ago as the royal castle of the Ryukyu Kingdom, which ruled the island from 1429 until 1879 when it was annexed by Japan.
