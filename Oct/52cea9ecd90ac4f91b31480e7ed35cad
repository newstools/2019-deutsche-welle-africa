It will take two hours to reach the mainland," Narin told Reuters. "According to the people who are transporting her body, it's almost 100 percent her, looking at her body's markings, including tattoo," Narin said. Amelia Bambridge's brother, Harry Bambridge, gave a press conference during the search after the 21-year-old British tourist went missing last week The police chief added that Bambridge's family was with the authorities when they found the body but it was not immediately known if or when they might view the body. The police are expected to carry out an autopsy when the body reaches the mainland. Earlier indications had pointed to drowning as the cause of death. The discovery of Bambridge's bag with money, a cellphone and a watch on a rock near the edge of the ocean on Koh Rong had prompted an investigation that comprised of divers, land-based teams and police drones. Around 150 people took part in the search and included sniffer dogs, divers and police drones mvb/rt (AP, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
