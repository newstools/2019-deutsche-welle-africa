The beetle will be named nelloptodes gretae and belongs to the Ptiliidae family of beetles.

He underlined that the pale yellow and gold beetle's size, less than one millimeter across, had not been a factor in the decision to name it after the 16-year-old.

The species was collected in Kenya in the 1960s but was only recently examined in London. Darby has previously named another species of the beetle after British naturalist David Attenborough. Thunberg is currently in Vancouver, Canada, after taking part in climate protests across North America and speaking at the UN climate summit in September. She rose to international prominence after she began school strikes in August 2018 that sparked the global youth-led climate change protest movement Fridays for Future. ed/stb (dpa, AP) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3QQkM
