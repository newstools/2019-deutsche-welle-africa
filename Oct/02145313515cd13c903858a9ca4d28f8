A parliamentary committee on Monday recommended a six-month suspension for Labour Member of Parliament (MP) Keith Vaz over a drug scandal. The committee found that he has caused "significant damage to the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons," after he was caught on tape offering to procure cocaine for people posing as male escorts in August 2016.

"We recommend that the House should suspend Mr Vaz from its service for six months."
