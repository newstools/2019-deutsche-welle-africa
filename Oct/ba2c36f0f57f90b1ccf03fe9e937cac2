Organizers of Japan’s Formula One Grand Prix car race have canceled the full Saturday program as the nation prepares for Typhoon Hagibis to hit. The final practice session will not be held and qualifying rounds scheduled for Saturday have been pushed back to Sunday.

This means the final practice sessions for drivers will be held on Friday before the qualifying sessions begin on Sunday.

It is possible that the storm could affect Sunday's program as well. But organizers say postponing the race until Monday is impossible.

French race car driver Jules Bianchi died due to injuries sustained at a crash at Suzuka in 2014, when rain and poor visibility caused him to lose control during a race.

Operators have also already canceled more than 1,000 flights scheduled for Saturday as well as many train services. Heavy rains and winds in excess of 200 kilometers (125 miles) per hour are expected. The typhoon arrives just a month after another Typhoon Faxai swept through eastern Japan, killing one person and causing massive damage and power outages. kp/rc (dpa, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
