German authorities said on Friday that a 2016 deadly gun attack in Munich was at least partly motivated by the right-wing extremist views of the perpetrator. The 18-year-old attacker, identified as David Ali S., shot and killed nine people and then himself at a restaurant in the Olympia shopping mall in Munich in July 2016. An expert panel previously deemed the attack to be motivated by right-wing extremism in 2017, but this is the first time that German authorities have conceded this.
