A German neo-Nazi politician whose election to a town council caused international outcry has been voted out of his post. On Tuesday the town council in Altenstadt-Waldsiedlung in the central state of Hesse voted to remove from the council Stefan Jagsch, a member of the National Democratic Party (NPD), an extreme-right wing party with neo-Nazi ties. Jagsch's election last month was condemned in Germany and abroad. Following the uproar, the council immediately made a motion to have him removed.

Jagsch was voted onto the council unanimously in September. The members who elected him, who included members of the CDU, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP), explained the decision by saying no other candidates had run. Jagsch has said he will take legal action against the decision. kp/rt (EPD, dpa) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features. Sign up here
