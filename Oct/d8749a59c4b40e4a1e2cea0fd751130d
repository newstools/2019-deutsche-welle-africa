An armed man stole an ambulance and drove it into several people in the Norwegian capital of Oslo on Tuesday, police said. Authorities arrested the man after firing on the vehicle. The 32-year-old Norwegian was not injured and is suspected of attempted murder, police said. "The ambulance was hijacked. The three personnel who were in the ambulance were physically unharmed but of course shaken by the incident," an Oslo University Hospital spokesman told local news agency NTB. "Some minutes later one of our other ambulances managed to stop the hijacked vehicle by crashing into it. Then the police came after the crash and got him," he said. Public broadcaster NRK showed video of an ambulance driving in the Torshov neighborhood while several gunshots rang out. An elderly couple and a mother pushing two children in a stroller were hit by the hijacked ambulance. The woman and the children were taken to the hospital. All were slightly injured, including the two babies. "There is nothing to indicate that this incident is terrorism related," Oslo police operations leader Erik Hestvik said. Hestvik told dpa that a woman was arrested hours later in connection to the incident. He said the pair were previously known to police. A shotgun and a semi-automatic weapon were seized from the man, when the ambulance came to a halt. Police wrote on Twitter that the woman appeared to be under the influence of drugs. aw,jcg/ng (Reuters, AP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
