UK opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday told his top team of policy advisers the party's condition for supporting a new election had been met and "we will now launch the most ambitious and radical" election campaign. "I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a no deal Brexit being off the table," he told his so-called shadow cabinet, according to his office.

We will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen." More to follow...
