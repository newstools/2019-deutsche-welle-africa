Sometimes finding the right formula is all it takes to make a global hit. Such is the case with 2016 Italian film Perfetti sconosciuti ("Perfect strangers"), by director Paolo Genovese. The movie, about a dinner party with friends gone terribly wrong, has been remade 18 times since its release in countries such as Greece, Turkey, South Korea, and India. It has even earned a place in the Guinness World Records as the most remade movie in history. Now, audiences in Germany will have their own version of the story. Entitled Das perfekte Geheimnis ("The perfect secret"), it starts screening in German cinemas on October 31.
