Kenya's Brigid Kosgei broke Paula Radcliffe's previous record of 2:15:25, which the Briton set at the London Marathon on April 13, 2003. Radcliffe was present at the Chicago Marathon and witnessed the fall of her record. "When I saw how fast Brigid was running in the first part of the race, if she was able to hold that together, she was always going to beat the time," Radcliffe said. It was also Kosgei's second straight win at the Chicago Marathon. 25-year-old Kosgei also won the London Marathon in April and recorded the fastest half-marathon in history this year by winning in 1 hour, four minutes and 28 seconds. Kosgei crossed the finish line alone, with Ethiopians Ababel Yeshaneh and Gelete Burka came a distant second and third in 2:20:51 and 2:20:55.
