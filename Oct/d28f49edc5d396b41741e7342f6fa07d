A longtime employee of a weapons factory in the western German town of Arnsberg is facing charges that he smuggled out gun parts, assembled them at home and sold functional weapons for years. The trial of the 47-year-old man starts on Thursday morning. German police have repeatedly gotten hold of unregistered weapons, which traced back to parts that were smuggled out of the Arnsberg company, Umarex. After security measures at the company were optimized, the suspect was caught trying to smuggle out a pistol barrel. Umarex CEO Eyck Pflaumer told local daily Westfalenpost that security at the plant was "tighter than at airports."
