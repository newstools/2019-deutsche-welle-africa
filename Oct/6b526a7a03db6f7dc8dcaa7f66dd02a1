A runaway cow triggered an hourslong police chase in the Bavarian town of Sand am Main, with authorities deploying several police cars and a helicopter equipped with a thermal camera. Local volunteer firefighters were also asked to assist in boxing the animal in. The 600-kilogram (1,324-pound) bovine was tracked down four hours after its owner noticed it had fled his nearby farm on Saturday evening. "It may sound funny initially, but it was a very dangerous deployment," police commander Andreas Winkler was quoted as saying by the local Licha-Media.de news outlet.

With help from authorities, the other one was located near a supermarket but then took off again toward the center of the town. The animal trampled through a greenhouse and a camping ground, prompting police to warn residents to move out of the way. The spooked animal also destroyed a scooter and damaged a police car.

Eventually, a police helicopter discovered the animal in a dead-end alleyway. Police and the volunteer fire department used their vehicles to cut off its retreat and a veterinarian used a blowpipe to shoot the animal with a tranquillizer dart. According to the dpa news agency, the owner managed to transport it back to the farm early on Sunday.
