Convicted Russian agent Maria Butina arrived home in Moscow on Saturday after being deported by the United States following her release from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida.

She was accompanied by her father, who had come from their Siberian hometown of Barnaul to meet her. "I am very, very, very happy to be back home. I am very grateful to everyone who supported me — all the Russian citizens who helped and wrote me letters and donated money for my defense," she said. The former American University graduate student pleaded guilty in December last year to conspiring to act as an unregistered agent for Russia. The plea deal saw her sentenced to 18 months jail. She admitted that she and a former Russian lawmaker worked to leverage contacts in the National Rifle Association to pursue back channels to American conservatives — but she insisted that she was never a spy. The Russian government has repeatedly denied Butina had any involvement with its intelligence agencies, saying the case made against her was politically motivated. law/stb (AP, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
