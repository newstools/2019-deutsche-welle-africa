The remnants of Genoa's Morandi motorway bridge that collapsed nearly a year ago were demolished on Friday to make way for a new bridge, Italian authorities said. The bridge collapsed amid bad weather on August 14, 2018, killing 43 people. The remains of the 4,500-ton Morandi bridge were detonated at 9:37 a.m. (0737 UTC) and took just seven seconds to collapse in a cloud of dust, city authorities said. The bridge's deck lies in rubble after being blown up on Friday Nearly 4,000 residents were evacuated ahead of the demolition and water tanks were placed around the towers to prevent the spread of dust. Some 400 security forces personnel were also deployed to the area.
