Manchester City lodged an appeal on Thursday with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) following the threat of banning the Premier League outfit from participating in the 2020/21 Champions League. City launched the legal proceedings as they believe the claims that they breached UEFA'S Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations are "entirely false".
