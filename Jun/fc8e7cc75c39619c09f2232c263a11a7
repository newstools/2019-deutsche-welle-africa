Houses were flooded due to heavy rain and damaged by hail, which meteorologists described as being 5 centimeter (nearly 2 inches) in size. Some witnesses, however, reported hail the size of tennis balls (over 6.5 centimeters) pounding cars on a federal highway in Bavaria, smashing car windows and side mirrors.
