German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer on Tuesday said authorities are working under the assumption that the murder of a politician in the central German city of Kassel was politically motivated. "According to what we know, we must now assume that the perpetrator is a right-wing extremist and that the crime has a right-wing extremist backdrop," Seehofer said at a press conference. Walter Lübcke, district president of Kassel and supporter of Chancellor Angela Merkel's open door policy for refugees, was shot dead earlier this month. He received a bullet wound to the head in what appeared to be an execution-style assassination.

Federal prosecutors took over the case on Monday, one of the first signs the murder was the result of a politically motivated attack. Seehofer confirmed those suspicions on Tuesday. "A right-wing extremist attack on a leading representative of the state is an alarm bell and is directed against us all," Seehofer said. "Right-wing extremism is a considerable and serious problem to our free society." If prosecutors prove that the murder was politically motivated, it would be the first of its kind on a sitting politician in Germany since the 1970s. Federal prosecutors on Monday said there was no evidence to suggest the suspect was part of a far-right network.
