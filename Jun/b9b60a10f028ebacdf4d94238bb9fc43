A 16-year-old's birthday party turned from a family affair into a ugly rampage on Friday night when up to 400 uninvited guests descended on the celebration. Police in the town of Grünstadt, around 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Mannheim, said the party got entirely out of control as many of the gatecrashers were drunk and behaving aggressively. The birthday girl and her father were overwhelmed by the arrival of so many uninvited guests to the community center where the event was being held. The amount of noise and disturbance prompted several neighbors to call the police.
