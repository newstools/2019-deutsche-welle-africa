General Franco's remains are to stay where they are after the Supreme Court halted proceedings to exhume the dictator's body. Judges suspended the exhumation until after they have ruled on an appeal by Franco's family to block the government's decision to move the tomb.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wanted to move Franco on June 10 from his current resting place at the Valley of the Fallen to a public cemetery near Madrid. Sanchez's socialist government (PSOE) said Spain could not "continue to glorify" the former dictator and that they were "convinced" that the court will turn down the appeal when it gives its eventual verdict "in the coming months." Family lawyer seeks dignity However, Luis Felipe Utrera, an attorney for Franco's family, said: "The government wanted to move Franco's body as if it was a piece of furniture," adding that PSOE was acting "out of a political motivation." The Valley of the Fallen, a mausoleum run by the Catholic Church, has become synonymous with right-wing demonstrators who have used the setting to air their political views. It was built at the behest of Franco between 1940 and 1959, using forced labor by some 20,000 political prisoners.
