The French state was responsible for heavy air pollution around Paris, a local court ruled on Monday in a groundbreaking decision. The administrative court of Montreuil found the government had failed to take sufficient measures to limit air pollution around the capital city. A local resident sued after she and her daughter contracted bronchitis and asthma respectively after suffering through heavy pollution between 2012 and 2016. The court ruled there was insufficient evidence to award damages for the ailments, but it did find the state had repeatedly failed to take sufficient measures to prevent pollution from rising above legal thresholds. "The state was deficient in not taking sufficient measures to remedy the situation," the court ruling read.
