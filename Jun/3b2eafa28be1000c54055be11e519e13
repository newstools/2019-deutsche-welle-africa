As a result, authorities are not expecting to find any more bodies, Cypriot media reported on Thursday. The body of a sixth victim is carried away after being retrieved from a quarry near the capital, Nicosia Since April, police have discovered the bodies of five women and two children, all of whom are believed to have come from Asia or Romania. The women had worked as maids on the island. Police have come under fire for their handling of the case, leading many to believe their inefficiency was due to the victims' nationalities.
