They allegedly lured the women either to an apartment in Krefeld, or to a hotel room booked in the victim's name, where the sexual assaults took place. The victims were held for several hours, and in some cases the perpetrators filmed the attacks on their cell phones, police said. Investigators said it was likely there were further victims who had not yet contacted police. They appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward.
