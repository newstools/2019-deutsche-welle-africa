A Bosnian man wanted in connection with the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks has been arrested on a European warrant issued by Belgium, German prosecutors said Thursday. German federal police and prosecutors in Dresden, the capital of Saxony state, said the 39-year-old suspect was arrested a week ago in neighboring Saxony-Anhalt state. The unnamed man was accused of "abetting a terrorist organization linked to the terror attacks, including on the Bataclan concert hall, on November 13, 2015 in Paris," they said in a joint statement. A court in Merseburg, Saxony-Anhalt, have ordered him to be held in custody, said regional prosecutors, adding that they were considering his extradition to Belgium.
