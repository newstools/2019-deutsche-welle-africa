Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for enrolling in Digital Empowerment 101. By the end of this session, you will have learned how to harness your personal data to regain your financial freedom and live the life you've always dreamed of. To start, turn to the person next to you. Tell them your name, age and hometown. Congratulations. You've just flushed $50 (â‚¬44) down the toilet. Understand the value of your data Rule one of Digital Empowerment 101: Never give your information away for free. Sold as a bundle, your name, age and hometown are currently valued at approximately one small home appliance. As part of your first assignment, you will head to a department store of your choice.

Instead, select the blender, coffee machine or soup maker of your choice and proceed to the cash desk. When your item has been scanned, look the cashier in the eye and say: "Julie, 54, Brattleboro, Vermont." You must deliver this information in a calm, matter-of-fact manner. If you are asked to verify your payment option, it is enough to produce a national ID card or a photograph of you looking at home at a local fete. If you would like extra store credit, lean in and reveal your monthly income. It is important to deliver this information in a whisper to prevent third parties from accessing your personal information. Heed volatility cycles! Like all currencies, the value of your data can fluctuate. To assess your personal net worth, take a moment to look inward. Are you deeply insecure, easily swayed and highly impulsive?

Man: I'd like to test drive a Ferrari. Car dealer: No problem. I'll just need a small deposit. Man: I'm having a midlife crisis. Car dealer, looking smug as he hands over keys: Enjoy the drive. Please be back within 20 minutes. In the first example, the woman correctly assesses the value of her data as equivalent to a high-end piece of jewelry.
