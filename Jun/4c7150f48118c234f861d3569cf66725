The contagious virus can be caught from bats or pigs and takes its name from Sungai Nipah, the Malaysian settlement where it was first identified. There was an initial outbreak of the disease, which killed in excess of 100 people across Malaysia and Singapore, in the late 1990s. In an attempt to prevent infections spreading, approximately one million pigs were terminated, drastically affecting the Malaysian pig farming industry. It has a mortality rate of 70 per cent and its symptoms include fever, headaches, convulsions and difficulties in breathing. jsi/rc (Reuters, dpa) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
