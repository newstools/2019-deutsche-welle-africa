Several blasts ripped through an explosives factory in central Russia on Saturday, injuring at least 79 people and damaging 180 nearby buildings, the Health Ministry said. A ministry statement said 38 of the injured were workers at the plant, while 41 were local residents from Dzerzhinsk, a city with a population of around 230,000. Fifteen people were taken to hospital, many of them with wounds from shattered glass. Authorities said earlier that two people were missing.

A spokesman for the local emergency service said there had been a "technical explosion in one of the workshops, followed by a fire of around 100 square meters." The fire at the plant, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Moscow, also spread to a nearby forest before firefighters put it out later on Saturday afternoon. Russia's Investigative Committee said it had opened a probe into possible industrial safety breaches at the Kristall facility, which manufactures TNT. The plant was founded in Soviet times and is a major developer of explosives for military and civilian use in Russia. jsi,nm/sms (Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
