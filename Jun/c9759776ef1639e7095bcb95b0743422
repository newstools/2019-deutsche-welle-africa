The German chemical company BASF announced Thursday that it would cut around 6,000 jobs worldwide by 2021, with 3,000 of the jobs being slashed in Germany. In a statement, the company said the move was an "organizational realignment" that would "streamline administration and simplify processes," as part of an overall aim to have a smaller corporate headquarters and a stronger role for regional operations. The German press agency dpa reported that the majority of the job cuts in Germany would come from the corporate headquarters in the southern city of Ludwigshafen.
