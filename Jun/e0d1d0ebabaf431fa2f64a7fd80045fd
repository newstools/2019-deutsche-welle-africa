Flight disappeared over the English Channel Sala was on a private plane taking the striker from his previous club Nantes to his new club Cardiff City, after he agreed to join the Welsh outfit for a record €16 million ($19 million) just days earlier. Having signed on the dotted line for Cardiff, 28-year-old Sala then went back to northern France to collect his belongings and say goodbye to friends and teammates. The plane disappeared on the flight back to Wales from Nantes. Emiliano Sala was 28 There was an outpouring of emotion from the footballing world as authorities began to look for the missing plane.

The body of Sala was identified from the wreckage but Ibbotson's body has never been found. The incident has been mired in controversy - from the revelation that Ibbotson did not have a license to fly at night, to Cardiff's reluctance to pay the transfer fee Nantes feel they are owed Sala's father Horacio died of a heart attack just three months after his son perished. jsi/se (AFP, dpa, AP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
