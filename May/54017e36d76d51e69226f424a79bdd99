The South African government on Monday said it wanted an appeal to be lodged against the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) ruling on Caster Semenya. The Swiss-based CAS ruled earlier this month that female athletes withhigh testosterone levels would have to take suppressive treatment to be able to compete as women in certain events.

They apply to distances from 400 to 1,500 meters, and include the heptathlon. rc/msh (AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
