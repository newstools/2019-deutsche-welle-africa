An Israeli airstrike hit the office of Turkey's state-run news agency in Gaza, Turkey's foreign minister said Saturday, calling it a "new example of Israel's unrestrained aggression." Israeli warplanes carried out dozens retaliatory airstrikes across the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip in response to barrage of rockets fired from Palestinian militants as hostilities flared into a second day. Turkey's state-media reported that the building where Anadolu Agency is located in Gaza was hit with at least five Israeli rockets after warning shots were fired. No deaths or injuries were reported. Turkish officials condemned the attack, which is likely to add fuel to already tense relations with Israel. "Targeting of Anadolu Agency Gaza office is new example of Israel's unrestrained aggression," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu wrote on Twitter. "Israeli violence against innocent people without distinction is a crime against humanity. Those who encourage Israel are also guilty." "We will keep defending the Palestinian cause, even if alone," he added. Turkey's presidential aide Ibrahim Kalin accused Israel of striking Anadolu Agency to "cover up its new crimes." There was no immediate comment from Israel. Earlier Saturday, three Palestinians, including a pregnant mother and her one-year-old baby were killed in an Israeli attack, while three Israelis were injured by rocket fire. cw/jm (AFP, AP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
