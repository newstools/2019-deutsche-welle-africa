Speaking at a conference at the Vatican, Pope Francis on Saturday decried abortion as a way to deal with fetuses with serious illnesses. "Never ever eliminate a human life or hire a hit man to resolve a problem," said the pope. "Abortion is never the answer that women and families seek."

"Every child is a gift that changes the history of a family," Francis added. "This child needs to be welcomed, loved and cared for."
