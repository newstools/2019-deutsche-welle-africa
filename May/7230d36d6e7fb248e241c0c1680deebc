Wolfgang Schäuble, president of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, who served as finance minister during the eurozone's debt crisis, has lamented the impact social media is having on communication and decision-making. In an interview with newspaper group Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND), the conservative CDU politician said "the triumphant march of the internet, of the social media networks, change the tone of the conversation and hamper the exchange of opinions," he said. "That makes it hard to reach decisions," he added as social media channels often over condense content and keep people in a filter bubble that echoes their own views. Schäuble, who at 76 years of age calls himself a "digital immigrant," told the reporters that he does not believe the "complexity of the world can be captured in 280 characters."
