Said Bouteflika, the influential younger brother of deposed Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, was arrested on Saturday along with two spy chiefs. Said Bouteflika was seen as the chief architect of a political system that enriched the oil-rich nation's industrialists at the expense of the rest of the nation. After Abdelaziz Bouteflika suffered a stroke in 2013, he largely usurped the presidential powers and was frequently cited as his most-likely successor. He was taken into custody by the central security service.

The two generals held top positions in the power hierarchy established during Bouteflika's long presidency. The arrests of three key Bouteflika-era figures came amid ongoing turmoil as protesters hold weekly marches demanding trials for the old political elite and radical change to the country's political system. The trio were arrested for allegedly "conspiring" against the anti-government movement that has run since February.
