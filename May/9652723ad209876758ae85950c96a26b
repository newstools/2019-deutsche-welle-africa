It's never too late to get into politics.  Lisel Heise, a 100-year-old former teacher, has been elected to the town council in Kirchheimbolanden, a town of 8,000 residents in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Heise, part of a local grassroots group called Wir für Kibo (roughly, We for Kirchheimbolanden), got the most votes in Sunday's local election. She will serve as the group's spokeswoman in parliament.

"Politics has developed from humanism to capitalism," said Heise, a critic of Brexit and a fan of French President Emmanuel Macron's plans for a more deeply integrated European Union. Heise decided to stand for town council in part to reopen the town's public pool, which closed in 2011. For her, swimming is an "elixir of life." She also wants to establish a kind of youth club for children to play, entertain and make music. "The youth has been pushed into second place here," she said. dv/cmk (dpa, epd) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
