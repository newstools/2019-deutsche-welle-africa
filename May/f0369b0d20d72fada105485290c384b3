At least five protesters and a member of Sudan's army were reportedly killed on Monday as violence erupted outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum.  The violence took place after opposition groups and the military council struck a deal for the country's political transition, following the ouster of President Omar al-Bashir last month. Since then, protesters have been camping outside the military headquarters to support a civilian-led political transition. 'Unidentified elements' or 'militias'? It remains unclear which group attacked the protesters. The military council said the attackers belonged to armed groups who were unhappy with the political deal's progress. Protesters, on the other hand, said military elements linked to al-Bashir's former regime were to blame. Read more: Sudanese military: A pawn of the Saudis?

The military council also confirmed that the deal had been reached. "We agreed on forming the transitional authority on all three levels," council spokesman Lieutenant General Shamseddine Kabbashi told reporters. "Tomorrow we will continue to discuss the percentage of participation... and the transitional period," he said. Disagreement exists on that issue, with the generals insisting the transitional period last two years. Protesters want it to last four years.
