Hungarian rescue crews on Thursday searched for survivors after a tourist boat collided with another vessel in central Budapest and sank in the Danube River.  At least seven people were confirmed dead and 19 others were missing, rescue officials said. Pal Gyorfi, a spokesman for the National Ambulance Service, said seven people had been rescued and taken to hospital in a stable condition. Speaking to national television, he added that there was a "minimal chance" of finding any more survivors. The boat, named Hableany (Mermaid), was carrying two crew members and 33 passengers when it tipped over at around 10 p.m. (2000 UTC) on Wednesday near Hungary's iconic parliament building. Police said most of those on board were from South Korea. According to a South Korean Embassy official, the passengers included children.

The Foreign Ministry said it would send an emergency rescue team to Budapest to help in the search operation. Rescue boats searched for victims throughout the evening Strong currents make rescue difficult Dozens of emergency vehicles were stationed downstream from the site of the accident overnight as police blocked off the Danube in central Budapest to ship traffic. Divers were also scouring the river for missing passengers, but strong currents and high water levels following recent heavy downpours were making their job difficult. The capsized boat was a 27-meter (89-foot) double-decker able to accommodate 60 people, its owner told local media. Mihaly Toth, a spokesman for the Panorama Deck boating company, said the vessel was serviced regularly and had been on a "routine city sightseeing trip" when the accident happened. nm/cmk (AP, Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
