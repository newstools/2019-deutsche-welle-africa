Italy's anti-migrant interior minister vowed Wednesday to block a charity ship that saved 65 migrants off the coast of Libya earlier in the day from docking in Italy. "I have just signed an INJUNCTION ORDER against them getting near Italian territorial waters. Our ports are, and remain, closed to migrant rescue boat," Salvini wrote in a Tweet. The "Sea Watch 3" rescued the migrants off a rubber raft some 55 kilometers (34 miles) north of the Libyan port of Zuwara, a spokesman for the German charity said. The group included 11 women and seven children, it added.
