Germany cannot "underestimate" the potential for right-wing terrorism, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Friday after several hundred neo-Nazis paraded with torches in eastern Germany two days earlier. "If neo-Nazis march on our streets and there are more than 12,000 violence-prone right-wing extremists, then we cannot ignore that," he wrote on Twitter. "We must not leave the streets or the Internet to radical right-wing extremists."

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer condemned the march on Friday, German news agency DPA reported. It quoted the minister as saying he would do "everything that's possible in a free and democratic state to fight right-wing radicalism." Seehofer refused to comment on whether authorities in Saxony had done enough to stop the gathering.

Support for far-right groups is relatively strong in Saxony, where thousands of anti-migrant activists gathered last year to protest against migrants who were accused of killing a German man. The anti-Islam group PEGIDA (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West) was also founded in the eastern German state and held many of its rallies in Dresden, Saxony's capital. Saxony's conservative interior minister, Roland Wöller, said his ministry would probe the state's handling of Wednesday's parade. amp/sms (AP, dpa) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
