Thousands of people turned up in the Polish capital, Warsaw, on Saturday to show support for the European Union and encourage people to vote in Sunday's European Parliament election. Speaking at the rally, EU Council President Donald Tusk encouraged people to vote for pro-EU parties, saying it would be a vote for a "free, democratic, Poland without fear, without constraint, without contempt for others." It was the second time within weeks that Tusk had appeared to criticize the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party for disregarding the country's constitution and to stand up for the EU.
