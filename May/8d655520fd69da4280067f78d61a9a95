Last year, a similar plunder took place in Bad Soberheim in the same state of Rhineland-Palatinate, according to the TZ newspaper.

Germany produces some 160,000 tons of strawberries annually, more than two-thirds are for domestic consumption, according to the Chamber of Commerce for Agricultural in North Rhine Westphalia. Around 35% of the harvest is sold directly to consumers via farm shops and road stalls.
