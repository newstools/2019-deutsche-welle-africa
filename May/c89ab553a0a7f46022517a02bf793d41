The topic of burkas is one of particular concern for both Spahn and Günther. "When women and girls appear fully-veiled at universities and schools, then we do not just have the option to resist, we must resist," they wrote.

Spahn, who failed in a bid to become Merkel's successor, is seen as a conservative, while Günther is on the liberal wing of the party. The joint declaration also called for the European idea to become tangible in everyday lives of EU citizens. jsi/rt (EPD, KNA, dpa) DW's newsletter delivers the day's hard news and quality feature journalism by email.
