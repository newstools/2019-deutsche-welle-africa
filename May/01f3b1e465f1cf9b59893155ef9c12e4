A courageous truck driver and police joined forces on Wednesday evening to bring a runaway 40-ton vehicle to a halt on the German Autobahn, police said. The articulated truck, whose 54-year-old driver had collapsed and died at the wheel, was seen to be crashing repeatedly against the cement median barrier on the A1 highway near the western city of Cologne as it continued rolling at 15 kilometers (9 miles) per hour. Several truck drivers blocked other road users from approaching the uncontrolled vehicle from behind, while another truck driver and a car driver ran alongside it and attempted to smash the passenger window.
