Whether in a registry office or a church, tying the knot and committing to someone for life is still the happiest moment of many people’s lives. Getting married without a wedding ceremony is unthinkable for lots of people in Europe. And since it might only happen once in a lifetime, couples spend lots of time and effort creating their own individual dream wedding. We’d love to see your favorite wedding photo – either of your own or one you were invited to. Let us know whose wedding it was! Maybe the wedding of your best friend or a loved one? Perhaps you were even a bridesmaid or the best man? We look forward to seeing your pictures. As a thank you, we’re giving away a wristwatch in an exclusive Euromaxx design. The closing date is 31 May 2019, 12 noon UTC. All decisions are final. Good luck!
