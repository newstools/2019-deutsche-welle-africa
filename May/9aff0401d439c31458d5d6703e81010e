A motorist in the German town of Viersen had a lucky escape when his car — traveling well above the speed limit — was caught on a speed camera. Police have decided not to go ahead with a fine for the driver of the Renault Twingo because his face in the speeding snap was covered by a bird — apparently a dove. Although the speeding driver had been traveling at 54 kilometers per hour (33 miles per hour) in a 30 kph zone — which would normally mean a fine of up to €105 ($118) — officials said they wouldn't be taking the matter any further. In a press release, Viersen police joked that the Holy Spirit may have staged an intervention on the driver's behalf.
