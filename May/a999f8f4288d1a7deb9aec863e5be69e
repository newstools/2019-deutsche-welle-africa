Turkey's main opposition party vowed Tuesday to win the re-run of Istanbul's mayoral election, a day after the country's electoral council nullified the victory of party candidate Ekrem Imamoglu. "We don't think that losing is an option because we have won the elections once and we are pretty confident that we are going to win again," Unal Cevikoz, deputy chair of the Republican People's Party (CHP), told DW. "Mr. Imamoglu is not going to be the candidate of the CHP alone. He is going to be the candidate of all the people of Istanbul who are 16 million strong."
