Legal process questioned Lopez, from Paris, traveled with his family to northern Iraq before entering Syria, said French investigators. His lawyer, Nabil Boudi, was critical of the legal process, stating it was "summary justice." The French government had "guaranteed us that French citizens would all be entitled to a fair trial, even in Iraq." However, Lopez was sentenced to death "based solely on a series of interrogations in Baghdad jails," Boudi added.

The organization has accused authorities of eliciting confessions via torture. jsi/rc (AP, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
