Yemen's Houthi rebels are set to pull back from three ports on Saturday, the first steps on the ground since a ceasefire deal was agreed. The withdrawal of rebel forces, delayed since January, was expected to be complete by Tuesday, General Michael Lollesgaard, head of a UN redeployment committee said in a statement. The Danish general said he welcomed "the offer and intention" of the Iran-backed Shiite rebels to withdraw from the lifeline ports of Hodeida, Saleef and Ras Issa. The pullout was part of an accord, seen as the best hope in years towards ending the war, reached in Sweden last December. A UN observer mission, led by Lollesgaard, is set to monitor and report on the Houthi redeployment. A Yemeni government spokesman, Sadiq Dweid, said on Twitter that a Houthi withdrawal is "the first step of the first stage. We support the implementation of the agreement".

The Saudi-led coalition claims the rebels are using the ports to smuggle weapons, while the rebels say they would be starved of vital supplies if the coalition held control over them. The port of Hodeidah is one of Yemen's most important lifelines. More than 10 million people are dependent on World Food Programme supplies that first arrive there. rc/sms (Reuters, dpa, AFP) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
