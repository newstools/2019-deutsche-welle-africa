Many of you have sent us photos this week showing you in work clothes.  Many thanks to all participants! we raffled off an exclusive Euromaxx design wristwatch among all the entrants, and the winner is Muhammad Saleem Akhtar. He sent us this photo from Pakistan! It shows him dressed in working clothes he wears while tending the fields: "I use this uniform during my work in fields and harvesting crops, watering the plants and feeding the animals. This uniform is very comfortable." We believe that!   Congratulations!
