Filmmaker Bong Joon-ho on Saturday became the first South Korean to win  Cannes Film Festival's prestigious top prize, the Palme d'Or, with his film "Parasite." The tragicomic film explores the growing gap between rich and poor by telling the story of two families at opposite ends of the economic spectrum in South Korea. "The film is laugh-out-loud funny, an astute blend of humanity and absurdity, thrilling until its final depraved moments, a pristinely shot modern architectural feast for the eyes, a razor-sharp socioeconomic critique, and a cryptic operatic drama," wrote film-making news site Film School Rejects in a review.

Some believed Sciamma would win it to make her only the second female to do so in the prize's history. Others thought Spanish heavyweight Pedro Almodovar would pick it up with his most personal film to date, "Dolor Y Gloria." Instead, Bong became the first South Korean to do so. He is best known for his dramatic films "Snowpiercer" and "Okja."
