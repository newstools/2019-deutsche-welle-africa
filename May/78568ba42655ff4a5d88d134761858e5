Polls opened in parts of India on Sunday for the last day of voting in national elections, effectively wrapping up a six-week long electoral process. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency of Varanasa — India's renowned Hindu holy city — is one of 59 where voting is taking place. "Today is the final phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections," Modi said in a tweet. "I urge all those voting in this phase to vote in record numbers. Your one vote will shape India's development trajectory in the years to come."
