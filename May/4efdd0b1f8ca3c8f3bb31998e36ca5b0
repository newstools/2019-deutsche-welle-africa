At least one of the other dead was a schoolgirl. The motive for the attack remains unclear. Witnesses told local media that a man in his 50s had approached a group of children at the bus stop with a knife in each hand shouting: "I will kill you." Police and rescue workers rushed to the scene Japan PM sickened by attack Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was outraged by the attack. "It was an extremely harrowing incident in which many small children were victimized, and I feel strong resentment... I will take all possible measures to protect the safety of children." The attack occurred as Abe hosted US President Donald Trump for a four-day visit. Trump said "all Americans stand with the people of Japan and grieve for the victims and their families." Rare act of violence Japan has one of the lowest rates of violent crime in the developed world, and stabbings are relatively rare. In 2018, a man was arrested in central Japan after stabbing one person to death and injuring two others aboard a bullet train. In 2010, more than a dozen people were stabbed on a school bus and a commuter bus in a Tokyo suburb. cw,jm/mh (AP, dpa, Reuters) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
