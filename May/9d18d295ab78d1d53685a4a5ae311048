The German economy received a welcome impetus on Wednesday with the announcement that the country's gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in the first quarter of 2019. This followed a poor performance in the second half of 2018. In the third quarter of last year, the economy saw negative growth of 0.2% and stagnated in the last sector. Expectations for growth in 2019 had been lowered to 0.5%, from 1%, but the first quarter could suggest a slightly more optimistic year ahead for Europe's largest economy.This latest development will allay fears, at least for now, that Germany will fall into a recession.

The Federal Statistical Office cited private consumption and a thriving construction industry as principal reasons for the upturn. Nevertheless, Niklasch urged caution: "Given the weakness of industrial performance and risks from overseas, caution will continue to dominate." Germany's Economy Minster Peter Altmaier also greeted the news with a sigh of relief suggesting that it was a "first ray of hope" but echoed Niklasch's sentiments that there would be further obstacles ahead, such as international trade conflicts. jsi/sms (dpa, AP, Reuters, AFP)
