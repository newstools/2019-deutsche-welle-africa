Fonda was best known for "Easy Rider," which he co-wrote and appeared in with Dennis Hopper. The film portrayed the exploits two bikers on their way to the New Orleans Mardi Gras. Fonda earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the movie.

Peter Fonda embodied those values and instilled them in a generation," Goodfellas actress Illeana Douglas wrote on Twitter. "Independent cinema begins with Easy Rider," she added. Fonda began his acting career in Broadway in his native New York. He was also an environmentalist, co-producing the 2012 film "The Big Fix," which centered on the explosion of the BP oil rig Deepwater Horizon, the ensuing spill and its environmental hazards.
