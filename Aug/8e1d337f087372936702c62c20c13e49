A 36-year-old man was stabbed to death in Stuttgart on Wednesday with a weapon described as a "sword." The man was attacked in a street in the late afternoon, police said. Witnesses called police after the attack, which occurred during a dispute. The victim succumbed to his injuries despite rescue efforts. Tabloid newspaper Bild reported the victim was a German Kazakh. The attacker fled the scene by bicycle, but he was later arrested after a widespread search. Authorities could not confirm details about the identity of the suspect, but they said he was a 28-year-old who knew the victim. A police spokesman described the act as "unusual and appalling." The stabbing took place in the Fasanenhof area of Stuttgart, a residential district in the city's south. Some witnesses are said to have filmed the attack and uploaded the footage on the web. Authorities are now investigating the use and reproduction of the videos, as doing so is prohibited by German law. Stuttgart is the capital of the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg and is the sixth-largest city in Germany. Several major German companies are headquartered there, including major carmakers. It is regarded as one of Germany's safest cities.
