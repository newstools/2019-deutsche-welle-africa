South Korea will stop sharing intelligence with Japan amid an escalating dispute over history and trade, South Korea's presidential office said on Thursday. Exchanging military intelligence is not in the "national interest" given the "grave change" in security cooperation created by Japan's decision to remove South Korea's fast-track export status, said Kim You-geun, a deputy director of the National Security Council. The three-year-old military information agreement was due to be automatically renewed on Saturday, unless either side decided to cancel it.
