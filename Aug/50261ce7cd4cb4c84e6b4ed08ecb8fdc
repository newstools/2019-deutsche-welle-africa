A meeting of Schalke's honorary board on Tuesday deemed that Tönnies' comments, made in front of about 1,600 people in Paderborn last week, went against the club's anti-discrimination policy but "came to the conclusion that the allegation of racism is unfounded." While discussing potential tax increases to fight climate change, Tönnies told the Paderborn event that it woud be better to finance 20 power plants a year in Africa. "Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees, and they would stop making babies when it gets dark," he said.

I am sorry for the comment on the large number of children in Africa. "I am 1,000 percent behind our club values. This includes the fight against racism, discrimination and exclusion. On the basis of that I expressly wish to excuse myself. It was wrong, rash and thoughtless and in no way in line with our values. I am very sorry." Tönnies is to relinquish his duties as Schalke's supervisory board chairman for a period of three months, after which he is expected to return, according to a statement put out by the club on Tuesday evening. mp/se (dpa, SID) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
