South Korea's Trade Ministry said on Monday that from September it will remove Japan from its list of countries receiving preferential treatment in trade. The move deepens an ongoing trade rift between the countries. The decision to shift Tokyo to a new trade group comes after Japan imposed export restrictions on South Korea. Industry Minister Sung Yun-mo said that Japan would be put in a newly created trade category of countries that have not run their export control systems in line with "international export control principles."
