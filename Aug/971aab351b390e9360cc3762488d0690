Frankfurt police arrested three people on Friday after they allegedly tried to rob a bank near the city's central train station. All trains were halted as a result of the police activity, but regular services later resumed, train operator Deutsche Bahn said. In a series of tweets, police said that officers had been deployed in a street near the station and urged the public to avoid the area. The incident occurred after one of the bank's locker alarms was triggered. The perpetrators fled the scene, and a police officer fired one shot in the ensuing chase. Witnesses said they saw police pinning a man to the ground and that special police had been involved in the operation. Frankfurt's central train station is one of the busiest in Germany. Last week, a man pushed a mother and her eight-year-old son onto an oncoming train, killing the boy. jcg/amp (dpa, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
