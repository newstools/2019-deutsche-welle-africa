"All the patients and workers at the center are well," the university said. Health Minister Hala Zaid discussed the death toll with Egyptian television channel CBC Extra but did not comment on the causes of the explosion. Zaid said ambulances were sent to the hospital to transfer patients to other care centers. Zaid added that the search continues for other bodies that could have fallen into the Nile in front of the hospital. Read more: Can Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi make Egypt great again? Where is the NCI?
