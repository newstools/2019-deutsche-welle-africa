A 7-year-old boy in India had 526 teeth extracted in an operation that has been described as the first of its kind in the world. The hospital in the coastal city of Chennai, which conducted x-rays of the boy's mouth, found a sac embedded in his lower right jaw, full of abnormal teeth, showing he was suffering from a compound odontoma. "A total of 526 teeth, ranging from 0.1 millimeters to 15 millimeters were removed by our team,” Dr Prathibha Ramani, the college head of maxillofacial pathology, told the Times of India. "All the pieces were teeth, since they had a crown, root and enamel." "It was reminiscent of pearls in an oyster," Ramani added.
