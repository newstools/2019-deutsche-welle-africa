Two German men allegedly beat the rare capercaillie to death with a bottle on Saturday afternoon, while making their way home from a party, police in the town of Titisee-Neustadt said on Sunday. The men, aged 20 and 22, were intoxicated at the time of the alleged incident, which occurred in Germany's Black Forest region in the south of the country.

Onlookers, however, were enraged and attacked the men, according to a report released by the police. The angry crowd beat the suspected bird killers and poured beer over them, before detaining the two until police arrived. Police are investigating several of the individuals involved on suspicion of causing bodily harm and other crimes. Risk of extinction The capercaillie is at risk of extinction in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Encounters with humans are not uncommon in hilly regions where the birds live and the males are known to be very territorial. A special action plan is currently in place in Germany's Black Forest to stabilize the species' population. sri/jlw (dpa, AFP) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
