Police in the US state of Alaska said two German tourists and their guide were canoeing on Valdez Glacier Lake when they had an accident. Their bodies were recovered on Tuesday after a kayaker raised the alarm. The victims, all aged in their 60s, appeared to have been paddling in a single inflatable boat, officers in the port town of Valdez said. One of the individuals was found on an ice floe, while two others were floating in the lake. Authorities are investigating their cause of death.

"It's a very dangerous situation to be back towards the toe of a glacier when you have those types of unstable, large pieces of ice in the water," she said. All three victims were wearing life jackets, but they did not have wetsuits to protect them from the freezing water. "That water is glacier water, and it is so, so very cold," Pierce said.
