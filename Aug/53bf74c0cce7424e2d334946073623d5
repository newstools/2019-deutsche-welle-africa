Authorities declared a state of emergency in the Krasnoyarsk region. Unverified videos posted on social media showed powerful explosions sending plumes of black smoke high into the sky. Air traffic was suspended within 30 kilometers of the military site. Krasnoyarsk governor Alexander Uss said that between five and eight people may have been injured.
