During the Venice Film Festival international movie stars flock to the Italian city. Celebrity sightings abound from 28 August to 07 September, as actors and directors rub shoulders in the Piazza San Marco, luxury hotels and at gourmet restaurants. Some stars seek the spotlight during the international film festival. Others prefer quieter venues, such as San Clemente, one of the islands in the Venetian Lagoon.  If you could have your pick, which celebrity would you like to meet the most? We are looking forward to hearing from you, and as a thank you for taking part, all entries will be entered into our draw to win a wristwatch in the exclusive Euromaxx design.   I would like to meet …. The closing date for entries is 30 August 2019, 12 noon UTC. Our decision is final. Best of luck!
