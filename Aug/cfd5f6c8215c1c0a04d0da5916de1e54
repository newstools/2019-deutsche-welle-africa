German parliamentarians flew a total of 14.6 million kilometers (9.07 million miles) in 2018 for business trips, beating the 11.9 million kilometers that they traveled by air in 2017, according to a report by newspapers of the Funke Media Group. The report, which cites a record kept by the Bundestag administration, said that each of the 709 members of the Bundestag flew 21,000 kilometers on average. According to calculations by the organization Atmosfair cited in the report, the flights will have emitted some 4,000 tonnes (4,409 US tons) of carbon dioxide, which is a major factor in global warming. The environmentalist Greens had the most individual journeys per capita, at 1.9 flights each. The average across all parties was 1.2 flights per parliamentarian. The Greens told the Funke Media Group that they had offset the carbon emissions for all their flights.
