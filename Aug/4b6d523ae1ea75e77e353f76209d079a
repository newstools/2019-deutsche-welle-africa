Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was arrested on Friday ahead of another weekend of planned protests. The 22-year-old had previously served two months in jail over his role in the 2014 "Umbrella Movement" protests against a Beijing initiative to screen candidates for the city's top executive. He was released in June. On Friday, however, he was detained once more. "He was suddenly pushed into a private car on the street," Wong's political party Demosisto said on its official Twitter account. "He has now been escorted to the police headquarters in Wan Chai," it said. jsi/sms (AFP, Reuters)
