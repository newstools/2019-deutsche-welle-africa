Here we go again. After a long overdue title race last season, 2018-19 ended with the most familiar of champions, Bayern Munich claiming their seventh consecutive Bundesliga title and 29th overall. Hannover and Stuttgart, two clubs with huge tradition and fanbase, went down with Nuremberg while Cologne, Paderborn and, in a huge shock, Union Berlin are in the top flight. Bayern again go in as favourites despite doubts over squad depth. But Borussia Dortmund have spent big and early and Julian Nagelsmann could have a say with RB Leipzig. Further down, David Wagner will try to tame the Schalke rollercoaster, the Peter Bosz attacking experiment at Bayer Leverkusen continues and there are also new coaches at Borussia Mönchengladbach, Hertha Berlin, Wolfsburg, Hoffenheim and Cologne. Plus, there's the customary sprinkling of wonderkids. So, how's it all going to end up? Some of DW's Bundesliga writers put their necks on the line.
