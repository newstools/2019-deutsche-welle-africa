A German court on Thursday convicted an Indian married couple of spying on Kashmiri and Sikh groups in Germany on behalf of India's foreign intelligence service. The court in Frankfurt found Manmohan S., 50, and his wife, Kanwal Jit K., 51, guilty of handing information on such groups to India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Their last names are not given in accordance with German privacy laws. Manmohan S. was handed a one-and-a-half-year suspended jail sentence for illegal espionage activities, while Kanwal Jit K. received a fine equivalent to 180 days of income for aiding and abetting such activities.

The couple are reported to have received €7,200 ($7,974) from RAW for their services. During the trial, the two eventually confessed to regular meetings with a RAW handling officer to hand over information.
