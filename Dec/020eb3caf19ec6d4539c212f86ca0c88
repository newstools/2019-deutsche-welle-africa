At least 57 people have died after a boat carrying migrants was shipwrecked in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Mauritania, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said Wednesday. It was one of the deadliest disasters this year among people making the dangerous attempt to reach Europe. The IOM said a further 83 migrants who were on board swam to shore. The vessel, carrying at least 150 people including women and children, had been low on fuel as it approached Mauritania, the United Nations migration agency said in a statement.
