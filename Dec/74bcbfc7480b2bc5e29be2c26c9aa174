A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the southern Philippines on Sunday, striking 61 kilometers (38 miles) southwest of the coastal city of Davao, at a depth of 28.2 kilometers. A 6-year-old girl died when the building she was in collapsed on her in the town of Matanao, in the province of Davao del Sur. At least 14 other people were injured, though none of them seriously, local sources said. Matanao Mayor Vincent Fernandez said that the local town hall was badly damaged, along with two bridges and several buildings already weakened by previous quakes. "The shaking was different this time, it wasn't swaying. It's like a roller was rumbling by underneath," he told the DZMM radio network from an emergency shelter.  Following the tremor, damage to roads and buildings in the area was reported. A three-story building housing a public market collapsed in Davao del Sur's city of Padada. Rescuers suspect that people are trapped under the damaged market building, but they were forced to temporarily halt their efforts, said local police commander Alberto Lupaz. "They (rescuers) were attempting to check the rubble... the aftershocks were too strong," Lupaz said. Patients were evacuated from hospitals as a precaution. Ring of fire Initial reports had said the magnitude of Sunday's earthquake was 6.9. It was later revised down to 6.8. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a tsunami. The epicenter of the tremor was south of the populous city of Davao on the southern island of Mindanao, the same island that was struck by a series of deadly quakes in October, which left at least five dead. The Mindanao region, which covers a third of the Philippines, is home to around 22 million people. The Philippines is located on the "Ring of Fire," a geologically active area that is regularly hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. kp/cmb (Reuters, AFP, dpa) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
