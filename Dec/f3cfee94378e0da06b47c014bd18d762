The Greek government signed a deal to pay $279.7 (€250 million) to Lockheed Martin Corporation to modernize and enhance scores of US-made F-16 fighter jets operated by the Greek air force, the country's Athens-Macedonia agency reported on Friday. The two sides signed the deal this week after finalizing details on Lockheed's use of a Greek subcontractor. Greece boasts about a fleet of some 150 F-16 fighters. Earlier this month, Defense Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told the parliament that 84 of them would be upgraded to the advanced Viper class by 2027. The total cost of the upgrade program is estimated to reach $1.5 billion, according to the AP news agency.
