Three rescuers died in a helicopter crash during an overnight mission near the southern French city of Marseille, the French Interior Ministry said Monday. Three more people died later on in the day owing to the floods, leaving the death count at six. One was a sheep farmer trying to gather his flock who was swept away by floods and one was a stable owner whose vehicle was overturned in high water. The crew of the helicopter had been on a reconnaissance and rescue flight in the Var region when their EC145 helicopter lost radio contact. The helicopter and its three occupants were found at 1:30 a.m. local time (0030 UTC) near the town of Rove, the ministry said. "An investigation will determine the exact circumstances of this tragedy," it added. The country's Civil Defense said a pilot, an engineer and a firefighter were on board. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner expressed his condolences to the families and colleagues of the rescue workers on Twitter.
