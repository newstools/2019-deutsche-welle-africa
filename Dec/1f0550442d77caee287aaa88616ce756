The European Parliament adopted a resolution on Wednesday condemning so-called "LGBTI-free" zones in Poland. Most of these zones — where local authorities pledge to refrain from acts that encourage tolerance — were decreed in non-binding directives from local governments. Municipalities must also avoid providing financial assistance to NGOs working to promote equal rights. "The European Parliament urges Polish authorities to condemn these acts and to revoke all resolutions attacking LGBTI rights," the legislature said in a statement.

EU funds "must not be used for discriminatory purposes," their statement noted.
