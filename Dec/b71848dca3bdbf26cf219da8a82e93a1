Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life. Every two weeks she explores a new topic – from saunas to asparagus or the ins and outs of German small talk. This week she's back in London to talk to Brits about how similar the two cultures are, and to reminisce about the culture shock she first experienced when she moved to Germany. You'll find more from Meet the Germans on YouTube or at dw.com/MeettheGermans.
