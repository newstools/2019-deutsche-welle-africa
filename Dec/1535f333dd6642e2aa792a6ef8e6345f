Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life. Every two weeks she explores a new topic — from allotment gardens to money to language. This week Rachel slips into the role of Miss Sophie — a character in a comedy sketch, "Dinner for One," which has somehow become a vital part of New Year's Eve celebrations in Germany. You'll find more from Meet the Germans on YouTube  or at dw.com/MeettheGermans.
