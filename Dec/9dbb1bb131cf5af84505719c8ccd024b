The US Coast Guard said on Friday it was searching for a helicopter with seven people on board that went missing off the coast of Hawaii. The chopper was on a tour of the coast of the northwestern island of Kauai, where the weather conditions were said to be "challenging." The helicopter was carrying a pilot and six passengers, two of whom were believed to be minors, a statement from the Coast Guard said. A boat and a helicopter were sent to scour the area when its owner raised the alarm around 40 minutes after it was due back on Thursday evening, the release added. "We have trained crews responding and on scene searching for any signs of the helicopter and those aboard," said Petty Officer 1st Class Robert Cox, according to local media. Visibility was low and there were blustery winds, he added.

Helicopter tours are common above the island of Kauai, much of which is a state park. mm/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
