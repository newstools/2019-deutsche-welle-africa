Eurowings cancelled more than 170 flights scheduled for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday due to anticipated strike action by flight attendants at its sister company Germanwings. The Lufthansa low-cost carrier published the updated announcement on its website on Sunday. Eurowings said that it was in the process of minimizing the impact on travelers and that cancellations were mainly expected to disrupt domestic flights from airports that include Cologne-Bonn, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart and Dusseldorf. Some flights linked to Austria and Switzerland are also expected to be disrupted. On Friday, German cabin crew union UFO had called on flight assistants to go on strike for 72 hours starting December 30. Tensions have been building due to disagreements concerning regulations on part-time work. Germanwings operates flights for Eurowings. Around 30 airplanes out of Eurowings' fleet of 140 belong to Germanwings.
