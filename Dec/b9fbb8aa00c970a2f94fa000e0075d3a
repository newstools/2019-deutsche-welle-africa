Poland says it will award its highest medal for sacrifice and courage to a Polish national who played a key role in preventing the London Bridge attack from escalating. A spokesman for the country's justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro said on Twitter he would request the bravery honor from the country's president. He added that the man — known only as Lukasz— "risked his own life" and "helped to overpower the terrorist." British media reported that Lukasz, who works as a chef, snatched a 1.5 meter (5 foot) narwhal (whale) tusk from the wall of the UK capital's Fishmongers' Hall as Friday's stabbing attack unfolded.

'Hero Lukasz' "Being stabbed didn't stop him giving him a beating. Lukasz is a hero!" Video footage shows a man waving the huge tusk, while another man sprayed a fire extinguisher in the face of the knifeman Usman Khan. Lukasz' bravery was also the subject of several social media comments: The chef remains in a London hospital being treated for stab wounds following the attack which left two people dead. Khan, who wore a fake suicide vest, was shot dead by police.
