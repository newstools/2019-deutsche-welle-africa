About 650 demonstrators prevented supporters of the extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) from marching in the northwestern German village of Eschede. Police said demonstrators blocked a road into the village from an estate where several NPD supporters were staying, preventing 10 of them from driving down a road to the village in a van equipped with a loudspeaker.

Local media reported that the NPD rally had been scheduled in November, and that it was set to take place under the motto, "Eschede's beautiful side — give home and culture a place." The NPD members had reportedly intended to approach Eschede with torches, flags and protest signs. The counter-demonstration was organized by the Südheide Network against Right-Wing Extremism, the Celler Forum Against Violence and Right-Wing Extremism and the German Trade Union Confederation under the motto "Together against the Nazi meetings in Eschede". Last month, more than 7,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Hannover to protest another NPD rally.
