Mexican authorities on Friday said a municipal police chief was arrested in connection to the killing of nine family members of a Mormon breakaway group in northern Mexico last month. The mayor of Janos told local media that Fidel Alejandro Villegas, municipal police chief of Janos, was taken into federal custody for suspected links to the crime and consequently transferred to Mexico City. Although not officially confirmed by federal authorities, his arrest is considered the third of its kind over the massacre. Mexican authorities believe the gang that killed the family had mistaken their SUVs for those of a rival gang. The victims were all US-Mexican dual nationals and formed part of a breakaway Mormon group that settled in the area decades ago.
