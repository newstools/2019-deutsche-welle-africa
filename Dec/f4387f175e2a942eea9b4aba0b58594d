Two other scientists who assisted He were also handed lesser sentences. "The three accused did not have the proper certification to practice medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment," said the court, according to China's Xinhua news agency. "They've crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics."

In the US, the medical procedure is strictly limited to laboratory research. In China, while human cloning is outlawed, gene editing is not. The MIT Technology Review warned that "the technology is ethically charged because changes to an embryo would be inherited by future generations and could eventually affect the entire gene pool."
