German carmaker Volkswagen announced on Wednesday that it is planning to cut 5,000 to 7,000 jobs by 2023 to lower operating costs by €5.9 billion ($6.6 billion). Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, has been under fire since the dieselgate emissions cheating scandal broke in 2015. The company is expected to invest €19 billion over the next five years in developing cleaner electric vehicles and electromobility technology. Most of the job cuts are expected to be carried out through retirement offers. It is estimated that 11,000 Volkswagen employees will be eligible for retirement in 2019. At the same time, the company plans to add 2,000 jobs in research and development.

Volkswagen reported sales of €235.8 billion in 2018, at a net profit of €12.15 billion. Reuters news agency reported that automated digital administration and IT systems had already made some of the positions redundant. wmr/sms (Reuters, AFP, dpa) Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
