A Boeing 737 MAX was forced to make an emergency landing in Orlando, Florida on Tuesday after it experienced an engine problem shortly after take-off, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.

Boeing said on Saturday that a software upgrade for the anti-stall system was ready for the FAA to review.
