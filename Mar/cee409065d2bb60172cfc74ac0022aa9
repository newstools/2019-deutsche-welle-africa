Variable work hours and the ability to work from home lead to more hours worked overall in a job, a study published Tuesday by the Hans Böckler Foundation in Germany has shown. The issue of flexible working conditions is prominent politically at the national level, with Labor Minister Hubertus Heil of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) pushing for the right to work from home. Main findings Entrenching gender roles? "Work flexibility helps make job and family more compatible, but it can simultaneously cement the classic role divisions between men and women, or even make them stronger," said Yvonne Lott, a researcher in gender and work at the Hans Böckler Foundation's Institute of Economic and Social Research and the study's author. The double burden for women of working and caring for children is negligible for men, Lott added. Lott said she supported the SPD's move to establish the right to work from home while suggesting other policy changes to help engage fathers more in childcare and improve general work arrangements. How was the study organized? Lott evaluated data from a representative survey of around 30,000 German mothers and fathers from 2003 to 2016. The flexible work conditions included working from home, as well as partially or totally self-determined work hours. She examined how these conditions were tied to childcare, job overtime and free-time activities including sleep. What is the Hans Böckler Foundation? The Hans Böckler Foundation supports workers having a greater say in shaping their work organizations. It is close to the unions in Germany, which also tend to support the SPD.
