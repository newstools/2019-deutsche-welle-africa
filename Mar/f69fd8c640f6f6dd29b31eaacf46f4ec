The Eurostar rail service, which runs trains between London, Paris and Brussels, suspended all trains in and out of Britain for several hours after a 44-year-old man blocked the railway line on Saturday. British transport police said the suspect was arrested for "trespass and obstruction" of the railway. Local media showed images of a man carrying an English flag on the roof of the St. Pancras train station. In a statement posted on Twitter, Eurostar said its services would resume following the arrest, but recommended that passengers should change their travel plans if they could. Eurostar has experienced several delays and other disruptions for weeks due to a strike by French customs officers, who are concerned about extra workload should Britain leaves the European Union. shs/rc  (AP, Reuters)
