International transfers of heavy weapons increased by almost 8 percent in the 2014-2018 period compared to 2009-2013, according to a report published by the Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday. The United States bolstered its status as the world's biggest arms supplier, transferring more than a third of all weapons sold during the past five years.

SIPRI counted heavy weapons such as military jets, missiles and tanks, but ignored transfers of small arms like handguns and rifles. Why did the Middle East import so many weapons? Increased conflict in the region has increased demand among rich countries to import western weapons, SIRPI expert Pieter Wezeman said. How did SIRPI collect the data? Experts looked at publicly-accessible sources such as newspapers and government reports to collect data on each country's transfers. amp/aw (AFP, dpa) Every evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
