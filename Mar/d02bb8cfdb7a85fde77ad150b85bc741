I've never experienced anything so scary." During her airlift, the strong winds were "like a tornado" and she said she started to pray "for the safety of all aboard." "We were having lunch when it began to shake. Window panes were broken and water came in. It was just chaos. The trip on the helicopter, I would rather forget. It was not fun," American passenger John Curry told NRK. Lengthy rescue operation Police chief Tor Andre Franck said: "It is dangerous to encounter engine problems in these waters which hide numerous reefs ... therefore we would prefer to have the passengers on land rather than on board the ship." Rescue service spokesman Einar Knudsen told the Reuters news agency that rescuing all passengers "will take a long time." New vessel: The ship was built in 2017 and belongs to Viking Ocean Cruises, part of the Viking Cruises group founded by Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen. According to the company website, its passenger capacity is 930.
