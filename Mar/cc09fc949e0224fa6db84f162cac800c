"I am happy to see citizens come out and exercise their voting rights," Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters on Sunday after casting his vote. "I want to see love and unity. Everybody has one vote, one voice. Everybody wants democracy." The vote was foreshadowed by a cryptic last-minute warning from King Maha Vajiralongkorn who urged voters to support "good" leaders to prevent "chaos."
