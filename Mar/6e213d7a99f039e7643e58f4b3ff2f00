Jordanian King Abdullah II is to receive the "Lamp of Peace of Saint Francis" at a ceremony in the Italian city of Assisi on Friday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as last year's recipient, will present the monarch with the award and give a speech of commendation. Abdullah has been given the Catholic award for promoting human rights, interfaith dialogue and Middle East peace. Following the presentation in the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi (photo above), Abdullah, Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte are to hold discussions with young people and novices. As a present for the monastery in Assisi, the German chancellor will bring a piece of the Berlin Wall as a symbol for the overcoming of divisions. She received the prize last year for her "reconciliation efforts in favor of the peaceful coexistence of peoples." Merkel received much praise — but also vehement criticism — for opening Germany's borders to refugees in 2015.
