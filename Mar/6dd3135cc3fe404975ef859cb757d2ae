German police have filed charges against the alleged perpetrator of an anti-Semitic tweet sent to second division Ingolstadt's captain, Almog Cohen (pictured above), an Israeli football player. The tweet called for the player to be sent to a "chamber," an apparent reference to Nazi Germany's use of gas chambers during the Holocaust. The tweet was sent by a Union Berlin supporter during a match against Ingolstadt. "We strongly condemn this disgusting, anti-Semitic tweet in all forms and demand that it be prosecuted," said Rainer Koch, vice president of the German Football Association (DFB). The federation said it will pursue its own investigation of the incident. Ingolstadt thanked Union on Twitter for its "immediate support." As soon as the Berlin team was notified, they replied saying they had already notified police of the user. "Even after a most painful defeat, sometimes there are more important (fights)," Ingolstadt said in a tweet.
