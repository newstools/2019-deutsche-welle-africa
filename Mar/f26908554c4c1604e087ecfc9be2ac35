Eintracht Frankfurt 0-0 Inter Milan Commerzbank-Arena, Frankfurt Eintracht Frankfurt's fans rose to the occasion in the first leg of their side's Europe League last 16 tie with Inter Milan on Thursday, but Frankfurt's goal scorers unfortunately did not. Despite several scoring chances — Frankfurt had 16 shots in the game, seven of which were on target — the Eagles head into next week's second leg in Italy with the tie locked at 0-0. Inter Milan had a chance to get a crippling away goal in the first half when referee William Collum awarded a penalty to the away side after Gelson Fernandes tackled Lautaro Martinez in the box. But Kevin Trapp denied the visitors the lead, saving the ensuing spotkick by Marcelo Brozovic to keep the score level.

The hosts arguably could have had a penalty of their own moments later when Haller went down in the box, but Collum elected not to give the home side a spot kick. Mokoto Hasebe was then booked for protesting the Scottish referee's decision and Frankfurt's manager Adi Hütter was the stands after kicking a water bottle towards the Inter Milan bench in frustration. The two sides will face off in a week's time at the San Siro stadium in Milan with a ticket to the Europa League quarterfinals on the line.
