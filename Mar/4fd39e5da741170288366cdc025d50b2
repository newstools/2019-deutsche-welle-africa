In a joint statement, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called for the full report to be released and reminded the public that Mueller's report did not exonerate the president. "For the president to say he is completely exonerated directly contradicts the words of Mr. Mueller and is not to be taken with any degree of credibility," they said. Pelosi and Schumer also noted Barr's "public record of bias against the Special Counsel's inquiry," saying he was not "not a neutral observer" and could not be objective about the report. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev welcomed the findings as chance to "reset US-Russian teis," but was unsure whether Trump would "take this risk." June 18, 2013.

Author: Rebecca Staudenmaier, Jo Harper, Kathleen Schuster What did the investigation cover? Robert Mueller was authorized to look into "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the 2016 campaign of President Donald Trump." He could also investigate "perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses" committed against his own probe, as well as other matters triggered by the investigation. Will the full report be released? It's unclear. The decision about making the entire report public rests with Barr. Earlier this month, US lawmakers unanimously approved a non-binding resolution demanding the report be released. What happens now? Mueller's probe has ended and the team will be disbanded. However other investigations could result in charges beyond those brought by Mueller. jgc,kw/se (AP, Reuters) Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
