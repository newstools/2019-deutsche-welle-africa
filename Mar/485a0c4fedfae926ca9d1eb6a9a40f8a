It thrives in conditions of poor hygiene and is spread by contaminated food and water. Damaged infrastructure: Cyclone Idai left vast swathes of land underwater and destroyed vital infrastructure, resulting in catastrophic hygiene conditions for survivors crammed in makeshift camps. Difficult relief effort: Relief workers are trying to restore the damaged water system and bring in additional medical assistance. Complicating matters, more than 50 health centers in the region were destroyed. Death toll to increase: A shipment of 900,000 oral cholera vaccines is inbound, thanks to the World Health Organization, to help limit the outbreak. But as water levels recede and the level of destruction is fully revealed, authorities are expecting the death toll to increase. aw/amp (Reuters, AFP, dpa) Send  Facebook   Twitter   google+   Whatsapp   Tumblr   linkedin   stumble   Digg   reddit   Newsvine Permalink https://p.dw.com/p/3Fqma Every evening, DW sends out a selection of news and features.
