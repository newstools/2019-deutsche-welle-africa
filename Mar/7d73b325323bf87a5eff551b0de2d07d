General Saleh has repeatedly called on the president to step down or be declared medically unfit for office. Mass discontent: Anti-Bouteflika street protests erupted after Bouteflika said he would seek a fifth term as president. The president has since renounced his bid to run in the next presidential race. But he also canceled the vote, which was scheduled for April, angering many demonstrators. UN head weighs in: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Sunday that Bouteflika's government should take steps "that addresses theconcerns of the Algerian people in a timely way." Who is Bouteflika? The 82-year-old president has ruled Algeria for 20 years. He had a stroke in 2013 and has rarely been seen in public since.
