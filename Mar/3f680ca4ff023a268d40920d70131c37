Some 30 homes were damaged and five people injured when a strong wind funnel ripped through the town of Roetgen in western Germany. "It blew through, short but fierce," the local firefighters' spokesman said on Wednesday. Eyewitness reports and videos from the scene showed a funnel cloud that German weather experts later confirmed was a tornado. Firefighters said the storm carved "a path of destruction" through the town, according to the public broadcaster WDR.
