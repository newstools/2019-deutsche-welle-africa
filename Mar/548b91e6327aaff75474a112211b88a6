Police used batons and water cannon on Sunday morning against teachers who were protesting for better working conditions in the capital, Rabat. Authorities were trying to end a rally of some 15,000 education workers who planned to spend the night in front of the national parliament. Officers wearing anti-riot gear moved in after negotiations, which had been underway for several hours, broke down. Protesters chanting "liberty, dignity, social justice" were demonstrating against the contracts on which low-ranking and non-permanent staff are employed. A large number of the demonstrators, many in their 20s and 30s and wearing white shirts, carried candles or illuminated their mobile phones as they converged on the parliament area.
