Zverev fell to compatriot Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3, 6-1, who will now face Canadian 13th seed Milos Raonic. The match last barely an hour as Struff saved all four break points he faced to seal his first win over Zverev in five attempts. "I have been sick for a week. That hasn't changed unfortunately," Zverev, the world number three, said. "I think I just got unlucky, got a virus somewhere and that's how it is." Mixed fortunes in 2019 Expectations are high for Zverev in 2019 after finishing last season with victories over Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic on his way to clinching the ATP World Tour Finals.

The 21-year-old is now targeting his next tournament, the Miami Open, which kicks off on March 19. "It's now about getting healthy and about recovering and preparing myself for Miami, because Miami is a tournament I do well in."
