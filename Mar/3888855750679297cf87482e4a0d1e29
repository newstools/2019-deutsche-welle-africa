Three suspicious packages were found on Tuesday at Heathrow Airport, London City Airport and Waterloo railway station in the British capital. Scotland Yard said specialist officers assessed the three padded A4-sized mailing bags and found "small improvised explosive devices" capable of igniting a small fire if opened. A counter-terrorism team is now investigating the incidents, amid reports by Britain's Sky News that two of the parcels had Irish stamps on them. The TV channel said Irish police were helping in the probe. One package was sent to Compass Center office building serving the main Heathrow international airport, at 0955 UTC. The building, located close to Heathrow's north runway, was evacuated as a precaution after the package was opened and part of it burned. No flights were affected. Waterloo station was also targeted The second was found in the mailroom at Waterloo Station, a major rail and Underground hub at 1140. The station was not evacuated, but a small cordon was put in place. A third device was discovered at 1210 in the City Aviation House building near London's City Airport, a much smaller airport, where train services were briefly stopped as a precaution. Again, flights were not affected. London City Airport was one of three locations to receive the suspicious packages Police keeping 'an open mind' The Met said in a tweet: "We're treating the incidents as a linked series & keeping an open mind regarding motives." Key transport hubs in the British capital have been urged to be vigilant for other possible devices. No arrests have been made and no individual or group has claimed responsibility. mm/jm (AFP, AP, DPA) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
