Several hundred people rallied in the Croatian capital on Saturday to protest against a wave of lawsuits targeting journalists. The Croatian Journalists' Association (HND), which organized the Zagreb march, said politicians and other public figures had filed over 1,100 cases against news outlets and reporters. The group says the complaints are part of an attempt to censor the media and put pressure on journalists.

"The government is ignoring the problem because they believe ignoring the problem is the solution." Most of the court cases involve compensation claims for non-material damages such as "mental anguish" or "tarnished reputation." Croatian journalists march behind a banner that reads: 'You took over media, we won't give up journalism' The protest was called after Croatian public broadcaster HRT itself filed more than 30 lawsuits against its own journalists and others, including Zovko and his HND.

Reporters Without Borders says HRT is subject to "government meddling," while journalists in Croatia investigating corruption, organized crime or war crimes are "often subject to harassment campaigns." The media rights group has also voiced concerns about the fact that "humiliating" media content has been criminalized in the EU country since 2013. nm/bw (AP, AFP) Every day, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
