WWF pledged Monday to investigate accusations the organization and its partners engaged in a series of human rights violations. The move came after the publication of a year-long international investigation by Buzzfeed News, which accused the nonprofit of funding and working with paramilitary forces which disregard human rights in their quest to save endangered animals.

"Will WWF continue with 'business as normal' after these truly shocking revelations, or will it, finally, actually address the problem?" Director Stephen Corry said. WWF responds WWF is active in more than 100 countries and territories. Forest rangers face dangerous conditions and are often shot at or killed by poachers while carrying out their duties. In a statement, WWF said it had commissioned a review into the cases raised by Buzzfeed and asked the news organization to share the evidence it had. "We have stringent policies designed to ensure both we and our partners are safeguarding the rights and well-being of indigenous people and local communities in the places we work. Any breach of these policies is unacceptable to us and, should the review uncover any, we are committed to taking swift action," an unnamed WWF spokesperson said.
