He said the attackers continued to kick him once he had fallen down before he blacked out. The police video, however, shows one man hitting Magnitz from behind with his elbows after which two other people run past Magnitz. Prosecutors cast doubt on Magnitz's version of events when they said video footage of the attack appeared to show that while the politician was attacked, most of his injuries were sustained when he hit the ground. AfD's Meuthen supports publication AfD co-leader Jörg Meuthen told German newspaper Die Welt on Friday that he was in favor of the video footage being published. Meuthen said it was not a show of distrust in the police, but to confirm whether there is a contradiction in the version of events. "According to Mr. Magnitz, a construction worker [who alerted police] made the statement that [Magnitz] had been hit with a piece of wood," Meuthen told Die Welt. "The police said, 'We didn't see such an object,'" he added. js,law/sms (AFP, dpa)
