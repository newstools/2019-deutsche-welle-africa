Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah of central Pahang state was elected Malaysia's 16th king on Thursday following a meeting with the country's royal households. The appointment followed the shock decision of Sultan Muhammad V to step aside after just two years on the throne — the first abdication of a monarch in the country's history. The resignation came after his reported marriage to a 25-year-old former Russian beauty queen late last year. A statement from the Keeper of the Rulers' Seal, Syed Danial Syed Ahmad, said Sultan Abdullah "has been chosen as the 16th Yang di-Pertuan Agong (king) for a period of five years." He will be crowned in a ceremony on January 31. The 59-year-old, known as a keen athlete, holds key positions in several international sports bodies, including football governing body FIFA.
