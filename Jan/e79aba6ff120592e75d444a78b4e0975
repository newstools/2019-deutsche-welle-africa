French rescue workers uncovered the body of a fourth victim in a gas explosion at a bakery in central Paris, investigators said Sunday. Authorities had said earlier that they were looking for a missing woman. Two firefighters and a Spanish tourist were also killed in the massive blast, which happened around 9 a.m. local time (0800 UTC) at a bakery on Rue de Trevise in the 9th arrondissement on Saturday. Dozens of people were injured in the explosion and authorities said 10 remained in critical condition. The fire, which authorities believe was caused by a gas leak, gutted part of the building and badly damaged nearby apartments.
