Zverev had a match point in the second set but ultimately needed the get the victory. "Lucas fought well and played really well in the important moments," Zverev said. "He's a very tough opponent, and I think he's going to do well in the Australian Open." The first grand slam of the season gets underway in less than a a fortnight and Zverev added that the tournament, expected to be scrapped over scheduling conflicts, was proving good preperation. The German pair, who lost in the final last year, will now play Australia on Friday after the hosts beat Spain in Perth, also on Wednesday. The winners will progress to the final. mp (AP, AFP)
