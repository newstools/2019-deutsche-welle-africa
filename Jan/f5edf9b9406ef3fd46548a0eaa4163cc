At least nine people were injured when a man drove a minivan into a crowd of revellers on a famous Tokyo street on Tuesday. Crowds had gathered in Takeshita Dori, a very popular street in the fashionable Harajuku district, to ring in the new year when the man struck. Police said the man was in his 20s and had an "intent to murder." NHK TV aired video of a small van with the entire front end smashed while emergency workers rushed to the scene. The broadcaster reported he had told police that he was acting in "retribution for the death penalty" without giving more precise details. Police immediately cordoned off the street while the driver was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Takeshita Dori is closed to traffic and is often tightly packed with fashionistas and international tourists. New year's eve is generally a muted affair in Tokyo. aw/amp (AFP, AP) Every day at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
