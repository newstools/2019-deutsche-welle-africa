UN human rights expert Agnes Callamard met with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Monday as part of an inquiry into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in October last year. Although the meeting was closed to the media, Minister Cavusoglu tweeted this photo of the talks. Callamard is the UN’s Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Executions. She is leading the organization’s probe, which aims will assess "the nature and extent of States’ and individuals’ responsibilities for the killing." "The inquiry will also seek to identify ways by which States can strengthen fulfilment of their international commitments to protect the right to life, prevent violations and ensure accountability," Callamard wrote. The Saudi journalist was killed in October last year. Callamard is also expected to meet with Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul and chief prosecutor Irfan Fidan during her week-long visit to Turkey. It comes almost four months after the journalist was allegedly  strangled and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi family, had been living in exile in the US and was picking up paperwork ahead of his marriage.
