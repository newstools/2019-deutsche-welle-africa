Cambodia's ambassador in the US wrote to the head of Amazon saying the embassy had learned with "shock and dismay" that images of the Angkor Temples had been used on "ignominious products, among them toilet seat cover, bath area rug, contour mat, toilet seat lid, shower curtains, kitchen carpet" being sold on the site. Moreover, Ambassador Chum Sounry decried the "outrageous way to use the Flag of the Kingdom of Cambodia as design of bathroom mat set." "Dissemination of these ignominious products must be stopped quickly" Chum Sounry told Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO.
