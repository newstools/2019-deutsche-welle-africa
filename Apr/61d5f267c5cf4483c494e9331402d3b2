A Vietnamese woman who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in the killing of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be released in May, a Malaysian court ruled Monday. Malaysian authorities had accused Doan Thi Huong of murdering Kim Jong Nam in early 2017 in Kuala Lumpur's airport by smearing VX nerve agent on his face. But prosecutors agreed to reduce the charge from murder to "causing hurt by dangerous weapons" instead. After Huong accepted the charge, the court sentenced her to three years and four months in prison including time already served. Read more: The Kim Jong Nam murder trial: Who's who?

That decision prompted the Vietnamese government to pressure Malaysia into releasing Huong.
