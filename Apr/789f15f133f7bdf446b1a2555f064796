The Ukrainian ambassador's official car was deliberately rammed on Saturday morning as it sat parked in front of the consulate, an embassy statement said. "The police were called immediately, and the suspect's vehicle was blocked up. Nevertheless, despite the police actions, the attacker hit the ambassador's car again. In response, the police were forced to open fire on the perpetrator's vehicle," it added. British media cited witnesses as saying at least 10 shots were fired during the ramming incident which took place around 8:30 a.m. local time (0730 UTC), but which only came to light later in the day. No diplomatic staff were injured in the incident, which happened in the British capital's exclusive Holland Park area. Suspect arrested "The culprit was apprehended and taken to a police station. The police are investigating the suspect's identity and motive for the attack," the embassy statement added. TV footage later showed a silver car slewed across the cordoned-off road with its driver's door open and window shattered. London's Metropolitan Police later confirmed the ramming and subsequent shooting in a statement. "Police were called at approximately 08:30hrs on Saturday, 13 April, to reports of a car in collision with a number of parked vehicles near the Ukrainian Embassy in Holland Park. As part of the protective security arrangements for London, armed and unarmed officers were deployed to this incident," their statement said. Firearms and Taser discharged "On arrival at the scene, a vehicle was driven at police officers. Police firearms and Taser were discharged, the vehicle was stopped and a man, aged in his 40s, was arrested," the statement added. Police said the incident was not being treated as a terror-related. mm/jlw (AFP, Reuters) Each evening at 1830 UTC, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
