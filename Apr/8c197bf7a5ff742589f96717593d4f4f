Four alpinists from Germany have been killed in Switzerland after being engulfed by an avalanche while they were trying to cross a mountain pass on Friday, police in the canton of Valais said Sunday. The bodies were found on Saturday afternoon by emergency services who had been alerted by a mountain-lodge keeper when the four did not arrive at their planned destination on time. The group had been on the Grünhornlücke pass in the Bernese Alps when the accident occurred at an altitude of 3,110 meters (10,200 feet).
