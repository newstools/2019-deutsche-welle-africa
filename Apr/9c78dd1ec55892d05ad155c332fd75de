Rachel is on a mission to investigate the idiosyncrasies of daily life in Germany. Every two weeks she explores a new topic  from beer to nudity to complicated grammar. This week we're delving back into language. Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life. You'll find more from Meet the Germans on YouTube or at dw.com/MeettheGermans.
