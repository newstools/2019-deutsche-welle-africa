This week's Eco Africa brings you creative and exciting solutions to some of today's most challenging environmental issues in Africa and beyond. First we head to Liberia where illegal fishing is destroying fish stocks. But there is hope and fish catches have dramatically increased since the country started working with conservation group Sea Shepherd. Then we are off to see a new community-based approach to safeguard Guinea's mangroves. After that we follow students in Uganda who are learning to be both environmentally friendly and independent. Their school not only teaches classic subjects, but the kids also make charcoal for the kitchen, tend a garden and have a fish pond. It saves money and teaches them to preserve resources. It's a lesson for the future. In a similar way a program in Niger is pairing people with disabilities and benefactors who give them land to grow produce. Not only can they feed themselves and their families, but they can also make a profit and live from land that they cultivate themselves. Then we head to Europe to see how roaming herders are using a new app that reconnects the remaining spaces for free movement. And finally back in Africa we visit a man on a mission to save endangered animals in Nigeria by setting up a sanctuary for them. Check out the show and let us know what you think at ecoafrica@dw.com.
