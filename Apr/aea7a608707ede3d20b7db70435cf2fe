Germany's National Security Council, a secret security council consisting of Chancellor Angela Merkel and her chief ministers, has approved shipments of weapons parts to countries directly involved in the war in Yemen, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to several German media sources. The approvals come two weeks after the German government extended a ban on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which was originally put in place after the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.That extension, however, made a conditional exception for systems developed jointly with other countries amid anger at the German ban among some European partners, notably France and Britain.

"Apparently things are not going fast enough with new arms deliveries to the Yemen war coalition," said the Left's deputy parliamentary leader, Sevim Dagdelen. She described the approvals as "simply criminal and a violation of current European law."
