Thousands of people packed into the center of the small German town of Ingelheim near Frankfurt on Saturday in protest at plans to celebrate Nazi-era dictator Adolf Hitler's birthday. A right-wing group planned the rally to mark the 130th anniversary of Hitler's birth and expected 50 people to attend. But only 20 showed up, according to the German news agency DPA. The Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper put the attendance of the Hitler rally even lower, at just 14.

The Hitler rally, which was held under the banner "Maintaining the homeland, promoting the family and shaping the future," was initially banned by city officials, who argued that it would violate "citizens' sense of dignity, custom and morals." Dozens of riot police were deployed to the German town in case of trouble between rival protesters Organizers challenged the ban, a bid which a regional court granted, allowing the rally to go ahead.
