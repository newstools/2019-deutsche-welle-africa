He was then served two other arrest warrants, which allowed Japanese prosecutors to prolong his detention without trial. Last month, a court granted him conditional bail, which prevents him from fleeing the country and destroying evidence. Financial misconduct charges: The 65-year-old has been accused of under-reporting his income by 5 billion yen (€40 million, $44 million) from 2010-2015. He is also suspected of making Nissan cover personal financial losses since 2008. Ghosn denies any wrongdoing and has accused Nissan's board of orchestrating a coup against him. Who is Carlos Ghosn? He is a former auto tycoon credited with rescuing Nissan from bankruptcy. He is also the mastermind behind the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, a strategic automotive partnership, and chaired all three companies recently. The boards of Nissan and Mitsubishi dismissed him after his arrest, and he resigned as Renault's chairman in January. dv/amp (AFP, AP) Every evening, DW's editors send out a selection of the day's hard news and quality feature journalism.
