According to the International Airport Association (ACI), Istanbul Airport is the first major airport in nearly 20 years to be built on the outskirts of a city. The last project of its kind in Europe was Athens' Eleftherios-Venizelos airport, which went into operation in March 2001. Before that, Munich's Franz Josef Strauss airport started the trend back in May 1992.
