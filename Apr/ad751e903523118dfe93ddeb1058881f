According to preliminary data released by Germany's Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) on Tuesday, consumer prices rose by 2.1% year-on-year after an increase of 1.4% in the previous month. Market analysts had forecast a 1.7% increase. Eurozone stocks and German bond yields rose after the data was released. Inflation in the eurozone is expected to fall over the course of the year, due to a slowdown in global growth and a rise in energy prices. Economists expect annual eurozone inflation to rise to 1.6% when figures are announced on Friday. jm/js (Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.
