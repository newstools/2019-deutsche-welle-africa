Werder Bremen 0-1 Bayern Munich HALF TIME. 45' Max Kruse misses at the other end. His shot was deflected by Martinez and then gobbled up by Ulreich. 43' Gnabry fires over the bar from range with his left. Bremen just need to make it to the break without taking any more damage. 41' Disallowed goal, Thomas Müller. Period of real pressure from Bayern since taking the lead. Müller's cross from the left actually curled in all by itself. But Robert Lewandowski, who was offside, leapt for the header and disrupted Pavlenka's line of sight; so it's called back for offside. 36' GOAL! Robert Lewandowski. A bizarre way to open the scoring. A Thomas Müller header loops over Pavlenka towards the far post, hits the post and bounces back into Lewandowski's path. He prods it home from point blank. Bremen's defense and goalie wrongfooted first by Müller's header and then by its deflection back off the post. 35' Kingsley Coman cuts inside from the left for Bayern and rifles a shot wide of Pavlenka's post. 32' The hosts are putting up quite a fight here. Strong in the tackle, purposeful on the ball, buoyed by a very lively crowd. 29' After a couple of Bremen corners, Bayern break away at speed, but can't find a shot at the end of it. Extremely important sliding tackle from Sahin to prevent an attempted shot when the Bavarians did find an angle. 27' Mats Hummels joins Klaassen in the book. Studs-up challenge on Rajica, who's been very lively. 25' Werder's Davy Klaassen goes in the book for a late sliding challenge on Kimmich. Hard to argue with that. 19' Yuya Osako fires a shot wide of Sven Ulreich's post. Lots of chances at either end, but neither keeper has had to sing for their supper yet. 16' Müller again, arriving in the middle to meet a cross from Coman. Deflected wide for a corner. Bayern having a lot of joy down the left flank. 10' Thomas Müller misses a left-footed back-heel by inches, after David Alaba got to the byline to cross in low. Truly cheeky effort. 8' Chance for Bremen on the break after Lewandowski gave the ball away cheaply. Cross to Rashica at far post, he nods it down for Max Kruse, who doesn't make proper contact with the ball. Home fans on song after a strong start for the underdogs. 4' Some really fiery tackles in the opening minutes. Jerome Boateng tackles Rashica from behind and collects him in the process. Just a talking-to from the referee Daniel Siebert, no early card. 2' Bremen with the first promising attack, as Milot Rashica goes on a mazy dribble in Bayern's half. No end product though.
