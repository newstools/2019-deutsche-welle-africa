Thousands of people in Prague and across the Czech Republic have taken to the streets over the nomination of a new justice minister.  Demonstrators say Marie Benesova is too close to billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is accused of abusing EU funds to build a luxury resort on his land in 2007. Protesters fear the allegations may be brushed under the carpet, believing the appointment is far too convenient. Protesters carried Czech and EU flags and shouted slogans such as "Independent Justice," "We are not blind," and "We want an honest government." Benesova previously held the position of justice minister, as well as chief prosecutor "We fear that the prime minister might escape justice," said Mikulas Minar from the Million Moments For Democracy group, which helped organize the protest on Monday, speaking with Agence France-Presse. Organizers said that, in addition to the protests in the capital, there were demonstrations in some 100 other towns.
