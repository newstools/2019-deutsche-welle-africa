Britain's Border Force and coastguard intercepted three small boats carrying 36 migrants in the English Channel between France and Britain on Monday. The border agency said it responded to three separate incidents of vessels crossing the world's busiest shipping lane to reach the British coast. The first involved 11 men who said they were Iranian — along with an Iraqi — whose craft was intercepted in the early hours of the morning. The men were taken to the English port town of Dover for medical care and to be interviewed.

Almost 500 people, including dozens of children, have made the journey in small boats since early November.
