Police and migrants clashed in a field outside a migrant camp near the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki on Saturday. Some 2,000 migrants had gathered in the field before some of them began throwing stones at police as officers tried to control the crowd with tear gas and stun grenades, according to Greek media.

Many of them had arrived at the camp on Thursday and Friday amid rumors on social media about the border being open. "People exhorted by fake news were misled because of their hope," Greek Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas said. The Diavata camp is some 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of the border, which forms part of the so-called Balkan migration route for entering central and northern Europe.

Many migrants have so far ignored that call, but the ministry said it hoped most people would return voluntarily by Sunday. The number of migrants reaching central and northern Europe via the Balkan route fell significantly after a border fence was installed along the Greek-North Macedonian border in late 2015.
