German police arrested Alain Robert, dubbed the French "Spider-Man" for his daring feats in scaling some of the world's highest buildings, following his successful ascent of the 153-meter (501-foot) Skyper skyscraper in the western city of Frankfurt on Saturday. Robert took around 20 minutes to climb up the building in the city's banking quarter. The 57-year-old was arrested once he had climbed back down the building's sheer glass front.

An initial investigation showed there was no damage to the building. A life above ground The free climber — which means he climbs without ropes or other safety protection — recently made an appearance at the top of the 68-floor Cheung Kong Center in Hong Kong during the unrest surrounding a now-withdrawn extradition treaty with China.
