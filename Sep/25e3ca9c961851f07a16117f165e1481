Turkey's former-Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Friday announced he would resign from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), saying it had moved away from its "founding values." Davutoglu, who was prime minister and AKP chair between 2014 and 2016, said it was a "historical responsibility" to build a "new political movement and embark on a new path."

His resignation seems to have preempted an appearance before a disciplinary board for his expulsion from the party.

The move backfired, as the opposition went on to win the rerun of the vote by an even wider margin.
