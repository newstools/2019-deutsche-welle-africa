In his speech to the UN General Assembly on Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Indian forces in Kashmir would turn their weapons on Kashmiris when the current curfew in place is lifted. "There are 900,000 troops there, they haven't come, as Narendra Modi says, for the prosperity of Kashmir," said Khan, adding that when people are allowed again into the streets, the soldiers will "shoot them." "Women, children, sick people are locked in like animals ... there will be a bloodbath when the curfew is lifted," Khan said.
