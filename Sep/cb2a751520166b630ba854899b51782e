An iceberg the size of Gran Canaria has broken off the Amery Ice Shelf in Antarctica, in an event that was long-awaited by scientists. The calving of the iceberg, which has been named D28, was captured by the EU's Sentinel-1 satellite system. The new ice block has an area of more than 1,500 square kilometers (579 square miles). The last major calving event at the shelf occurred in the early 1960s, NASA and other experts said, when a block measuring roughly 9,800 square kilometers broke off.
