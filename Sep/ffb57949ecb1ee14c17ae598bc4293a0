A shot in the back of the neck, like Lübcke!" Grötsch said. History repeating itself This was a direct reference to politician Walter Lübcke, who prosecutors say was killed by a man known for his right-wing extremist ideology. Lübcke had also received death threats prior to his murder. "You can do what you want, you can threaten me with what you want," Grötsch continued. "You will not prevent me from living my life as I have always done and from continuing to fight against you."
