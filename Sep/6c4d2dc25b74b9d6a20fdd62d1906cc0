Neil Parker broke his leg in half and fractured his wrist in the tumble while walking by himself in Cabbage Tree Creek on Mount Nebo, northwest of Brisbane.

He tried to make a phone call, but after dropping his mobile "into the drink" reverted to crawling. After 48 hours, 3 kilometers (1.8 miles), "a protein bar and some lollies," Parker was spotted by a helicopter and winched to safety. The Australian cited his experience as a hiker as essential in his survival.

"I wanted to be around for my kids." jsi/sms (dpa, AFP) DW sends out a daily selection of the day's news and features. Sign up here.
