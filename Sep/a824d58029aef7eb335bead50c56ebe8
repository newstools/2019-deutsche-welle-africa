Seven people were arrested in a raid on a suspected cybercrime operation in Germany late Thursday. Police took a darknet server offline and impounded it, a spokesman for the police in the western state of Rhineland-Palatinate said.

Police believe that the data center was involved in a hack attack three years ago on the national communications provider, Telekom.
