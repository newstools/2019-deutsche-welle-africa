Rachel moved from the UK to Germany in 2016. As a relative newcomer, she casts a fresh eye over German clichés and shares her experiences of settling into German life.

Where do these fashion quirks come from? And which German city goes entirely against the grain? You'll find more from Meet the Germans on YouTube or at dw.com/MeettheGermans.
