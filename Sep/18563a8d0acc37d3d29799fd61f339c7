The Georgian parliament on Sunday appointed a controversial figure to become the country's prime minister in a move that has triggered protests in the capital, Tbilisi. Lawmakers voted 98 to 0 in favor of former Interior Minister Giorgi Gakharia, with the opposition boycotting the vote. Gakharia is widely seen as the chief architect of a violent crackdown against Georgian anti-government protesters in June. The protests were triggered by a Russian lawmaker addressing parliament in his native Russian while sitting in the Georgian parliamentary speaker's seat. But Gakharia tried to dismiss allegations that he is "Moscow's man" in Tbilisi by taking aim at Russia's occupation of Georgian breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. "We all agree that occupation is the biggest problem, the biggest challenge, the greatest evil in our country," said Gakharia.
